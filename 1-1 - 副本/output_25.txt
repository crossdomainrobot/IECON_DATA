To plan a safe and smooth trajectory for the double lane change maneuver, we'll break the process into phases: **lane change to the left**, **overtaking the obstacle**, and **lane change back to the right**. We'll assume constant acceleration/deceleration during lane changes and a constant speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) during the straight sections. Here's the step-by-step trajectory:

---

### **Phase 1: Lane Change to the Left (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)**
- Goal: Move from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -5) smoothly.
- Assume linear lateral movement over 2 seconds.
- Lateral speed: \( \frac{5 \text{ m}}{2 \text{ s}} = 2.5 \text{ m/s} \).
- Longitudinal speed: 20 m/s (constant).
- Positions:
  - T = 0 s: (0, 0)
  - T = 1 s: (20, -2.5)
  - T = 2 s: (40, -5)

---

### **Phase 2: Overtaking the Obstacle (T = 2 to T = 7 seconds)**
- Goal: Stay in the left lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstacle at X = 100.
- Longitudinal speed: 20 m/s (constant).
- Positions:
  - T = 3 s: (60, -5)
  - T = 4 s: (80, -5)
  - T = 5 s: (100, -5) (Passing the obstacle)
  - T = 6 s: (120, -5)
  - T = 7 s: (140, -5)

---

### **Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Right (T = 7 to T = 9 seconds)**
- Goal: Return from the left lane (Y = -5) to the right lane (Y = 0) smoothly.
- Assume linear lateral movement over 2 seconds.
- Lateral speed: \( \frac{5 \text{ m}}{2 \text{ s}} = 2.5 \text{ m/s} \).
- Longitudinal speed: 20 m/s (constant).
- Positions:
  - T = 8 s: (160, -2.5)
  - T = 9 s: (180, 0)

---

### **Final Phase: Continue in the Right Lane (T = 9 to T = 10 seconds)**
- Goal: Maintain the right lane (Y = 0) and continue driving.
- Longitudinal speed: 20 m/s (constant).
- Position:
  - T = 10 s: (200, 0)

---

### **Summary of Positions**
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)           |
| 1        | (20, -2.5)       |
| 2        | (40, -5)         |
| 3        | (60, -5)         |
| 4        | (80, -5)         |
| 5        | (100, -5)        |
| 6        | (120, -5)        |
| 7        | (140, -5)        |
| 8        | (160, -2.5)      |
| 9        | (180, 0)         |
| 10       | (200, 0)         |

This trajectory ensures the vehicle safely overtakes the obstacle while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
