To plan a safe and smooth trajectory for the double lane change maneuver, we need to ensure the following:

1. **Initial Speed**: 72 km/h (20 m/s).
2. **Minimum Speed**: Maintain above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).
3. **Lane Change**: Transition to the left lane (Y = -5) before reaching the obstacle at X = 100, and return to the right lane (Y = 0) after passing it.
4. **Obstacle Avoidance**: Ensure the vehicle is in the left lane when passing X = 100.

Let¡¯s break this into phases:

1. **Initial Phase (T = 0 to T = 3s)**:
   - Maintain speed and prepare for the lane change.
   - Gradually move from Y = 0 to Y = -5 (left lane).

2. **Passing Phase (T = 3s to T = 7s)**:
   - Stay in the left lane (Y = -5) to pass the obstacle at X = 100.

3. **Return Phase (T = 7s to T = 10s)**:
   - Gradually move back to the right lane (Y = 0).

Here¡¯s the trajectory in (X, Y) coordinates at 1-second intervals:

- **T = 0s**: (0, 0)
- **T = 1s**: (20, -1)  
   - Start transitioning to the left lane.
- **T = 2s**: (40, -3)  
   - Continue transitioning to the left lane.
- **T = 3s**: (60, -5)  
   - Fully in the left lane.
- **T = 4s**: (80, -5)  
   - Continue in the left lane, approaching the obstacle.
- **T = 5s**: (100, -5)  
   - Pass the obstacle in the left lane.
- **T = 6s**: (120, -5)  
   - Continue in the left lane after passing the obstacle.
- **T = 7s**: (140, -3)  
   - Start transitioning back to the right lane.
- **T = 8s**: (160, -1)  
   - Continue transitioning to the right lane.
- **T = 9s**: (180, 0)  
   - Fully back in the right lane.
- **T = 10s**: (200, 0)  
   - Continue in the right lane.

This trajectory ensures the vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h), avoids the obstacle safely, and completes the lane change maneuver smoothly.
