To safely navigate the vehicle around the obstacle, we need to plan a smooth and controlled lane change while maintaining a safe speed. The vehicle's initial speed is 72 km/h (which is approximately 20 m/s), and we must ensure that the speed remains above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s) throughout the maneuver.

### Step-by-Step Trajectory Planning

#### Initial Conditions:
- **Initial Position**: (0, 0)
- **Initial Speed**: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Obstacle Location**: (100, 0)
- **Left Lane Y-coordinate**: -5
- **Time Interval**: 1 second per step

#### Maneuver Plan:
1. **Start Lane Change**: Begin moving towards the left lane gradually.
2. **Complete Lane Change Before Obstacle**: Ensure the vehicle is fully in the left lane before reaching X = 100.
3. **Pass the Obstacle**: Maintain position in the left lane as you pass the obstacle.
4. **Return to Right Lane**: After passing the obstacle, smoothly return to the right lane.

### Trajectory Calculation:

Let's assume a smooth transition using a quadratic function for the lateral movement (Y-coordinate) to ensure a gentle and safe lane change. We'll also maintain a constant longitudinal speed of 20 m/s for simplicity.

#### Timepoints and Positions:

1. **T = 0**
   - Position: (0, 0)

2. **T = 1**
   - Position: (20, -0.5)  
     (Starting to move slightly towards the left lane)

3. **T = 2**
   - Position: (40, -1.5)

4. **T = 3**
   - Position: (60, -3)

5. **T = 4**
   - Position: (80, -4.5)

6. **T = 5**
   - Position: (100, -5)  
     (Fully in the left lane, passing the obstacle)

7. **T = 6**
   - Position: (120, -5)

8. **T = 7**
   - Position: (140, -4.5)

9. **T = 8**
   - Position: (160, -3)

10. **T = 9**
    - Position: (180, -1.5)

11. **T = 10**
    - Position: (200, 0)  
      (Back in the right lane)

### Summary of Path:

- **Lane Change Start**: Begin at T = 1, gradually moving to the left lane.
- **Fully in Left Lane**: By T = 5, the vehicle is fully in the left lane at X = 100.
- **Passing Obstacle**: Continue in the left lane from T = 5 to T = 6.
- **Return to Right Lane**: Gradually move back to the right lane starting from T = 7 until T = 10.

This trajectory ensures a smooth and safe passage around the obstacle while maintaining a consistent speed above 60 km/h.
