To plan the trajectory for the lane change maneuver, we need to ensure that the vehicle safely changes to the left lane, overtakes the obstacle, and returns to the right lane. Here¡¯s a step-by-step plan for the next 10 seconds:

### Assumptions:
1. **Initial Position**: (0, 0)
2. **Obstacle Position**: (100, 0)
3. **Left Lane Y-coordinate**: -5
4. **Initial Speed**: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
5. **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
6. **Time Interval**: 1 second (for simplicity)

### Trajectory Plan:
1. **T = 0s**: Initial position at (0, 0).
2. **T = 1s**: Continue in the right lane, position at (20, 0).
3. **T = 2s**: Begin lane change to the left. Position at (40, -1.25).
4. **T = 3s**: Continue lane change. Position at (60, -2.5).
5. **T = 4s**: Complete lane change. Position at (80, -5).
6. **T = 5s**: Drive in the left lane, passing the obstacle. Position at (100, -5).
7. **T = 6s**: Begin lane change back to the right. Position at (120, -3.75).
8. **T = 7s**: Continue lane change. Position at (140, -2.5).
9. **T = 8s**: Complete lane change. Position at (160, 0).
10. **T = 9s**: Continue in the right lane. Position at (180, 0).
11. **T = 10s**: Continue in the right lane. Position at (200, 0).

### Detailed Position at Each Timepoint:
- **T = 0s**: (0, 0)
- **T = 1s**: (20, 0)
- **T = 2s**: (40, -1.25)
- **T = 3s**: (60, -2.5)
- **T = 4s**: (80, -5)
- **T = 5s**: (100, -5)
- **T = 6s**: (120, -3.75)
- **T = 7s**: (140, -2.5)
- **T = 8s**: (160, 0)
- **T = 9s**: (180, 0)
- **T = 10s**: (200, 0)

### Explanation:
- **Lane Change**: The lane change is executed smoothly over 3 seconds (from T = 1s to T = 4s) to ensure stability and safety.
- **Overtaking**: The vehicle remains in the left lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstacle at X = 100.
- **Returning to Right Lane**: The vehicle returns to the right lane (Y = 0) over another 3 seconds (from T = 5s to T = 8s).

This trajectory ensures that the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h and safely navigates around the obstacle.
