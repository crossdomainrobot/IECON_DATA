To plan a safe and smooth trajectory for the double lane change maneuver, we need to ensure the vehicle:

1. Maintains a speed above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).
2. Switches to the left lane (Y = -5) before reaching the obstacle (X = 100).
3. Returns to the right lane (Y = 0) after passing the obstacle.

Here¡¯s the trajectory for the next 10 seconds, assuming a constant speed of **72 km/h (20 m/s)** and smooth lane changes:

### Trajectory Plan:
1. **Lane Change to the Left (Y = -5):**  
   - Start lane change at **T = 0s** and complete by **T = 3s**.  
   - Use a smooth lateral transition (e.g., sinusoidal or linear interpolation).

2. **Pass the Obstacle (X = 100):**  
   - Stay in the left lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstacle at **T = 5s**.

3. **Lane Change Back to the Right (Y = 0):**  
   - Start returning to the right lane at **T = 7s** and complete by **T = 10s**.

### Position at Each Time Point (X, Y):
- **T = 1s:** (20, -1.67)  
- **T = 2s:** (40, -3.33)  
- **T = 3s:** (60, -5.00)  
- **T = 4s:** (80, -5.00)  
- **T = 5s:** (100, -5.00)  
- **T = 6s:** (120, -5.00)  
- **T = 7s:** (140, -3.33)  
- **T = 8s:** (160, -1.67)  
- **T = 9s:** (180, 0.00)  
- **T = 10s:** (200, 0.00)

### Explanation:
1. **X-Coordinate:**  
   - The vehicle moves at **20 m/s**, so X increases by 20 meters every second.

2. **Y-Coordinate:**  
   - Lane change to the left: Smooth transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds.  
   - Return to the right lane: Smooth transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.  

3. **Obstacle Passing:**  
   - The vehicle stays in the left lane (Y = -5) from T = 3s to T = 7s, ensuring it safely passes the obstacle at X = 100.

This trajectory ensures the maneuver is safe, smooth, and compliant with highway speed limits.
