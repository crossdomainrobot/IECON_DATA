To plan a safe and smooth trajectory for the double lane change maneuver, we need to break the problem into phases: **changing to the left lane**, **passing the obstacle**, and **returning to the right lane**. Here¡¯s a step-by-step plan for the vehicle¡¯s position over 10 seconds:

---

### Assumptions:
1. **Initial speed**: 72 km/h (20 m/s).
2. **Left lane Y coordinate**: \( Y = -5 \).
3. **Obstacle position**: \( (100, 0) \).
4. **Minimum speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).
5. **Time steps**: We¡¯ll provide positions at \( T = 1, 2, 3, \dots, 10 \) seconds.

---

### Trajectory Plan:

#### Phase 1: Changing to the Left Lane (\( T = 0 \) to \( T = 3 \) seconds)
- **Goal**: Move from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \) smoothly.
- **X Position**: Distance covered at 20 m/s: \( X = 20 \cdot T \).
- **Y Position**: Linear transition from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \).

#### Phase 2: Passing the Obstacle (\( T = 3 \) to \( T = 7 \) seconds)
- **Goal**: Stay in the left lane (\( Y = -5 \)) while passing the obstacle at \( X = 100 \).
- **X Position**: Continue at 20 m/s.

#### Phase 3: Returning to the Right Lane (\( T = 7 \) to \( T = 10 \) seconds)
- **Goal**: Move from \( Y = -5 \) back to \( Y = 0 \) smoothly.
- **X Position**: Continue at 20 m/s.
- **Y Position**: Linear transition from \( Y = -5 \) to \( Y = 0 \).

### Vehicle Positions at Each Timepoint:

| Time \( T \) (s) | X Position (m) | Y Position (m) |
|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1                | 20             | -1.67          |
| 2                | 40             | -3.33          |
| 3                | 60             | -5             |
| 4                | 80             | -5             |
| 5                | 100            | -5             |
| 6                | 120            | -5             |
| 7                | 140            | -5             |
| 8                | 160            | -3.33          |
| 9                | 180            | -1.67          |
| 10               | 200            | 0              |

### Explanation:
1. **Phase 1 (\( T = 1 \) to \( T = 3 \))**: The vehicle transitions from the right lane (\( Y = 0 \)) to the left lane (\( Y = -5 \)) over 3 seconds.
2. **Phase 2 (\( T = 3 \) to \( T = 7 \))**: The vehicle stays in the left lane while passing the obstacle at \( X = 100 \).
3. **Phase 3 (\( T = 7 \) to \( T = 10 \))**: The vehicle transitions back to the right lane (\( Y = 0 \)) over 3 seconds.

This trajectory ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h and completes the lane change maneuver safely.
