To plan a safe trajectory for the double lane change maneuver, we¡¯ll break the process into three phases:

1. **Changing to the left lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Passing the obstacle (X = 100)**  
3. **Returning to the right lane (Y = 0)**  

Here¡¯s the step-by-step trajectory:

### Assumptions:
- Initial speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s)  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the left lane)  
- Smooth lane change over 3 seconds (to ensure safety and comfort)  
- Obstacle at (100, 0)  

---

### Trajectory:

#### **Phase 1: Changing to the left lane (T = 0 to T = 3)**  
- At T = 0: (0, 0)  
- At T = 1: (20, -1.67)  
- At T = 2: (40, -3.33)  
- At T = 3: (60, -5)  

#### **Phase 2: Passing the obstacle (T = 3 to T = 7)**  
- At T = 4: (80, -5)  
- At T = 5: (100, -5)  
- At T = 6: (120, -5)  
- At T = 7: (140, -5)  

#### **Phase 3: Returning to the right lane (T = 7 to T = 10)**  
- At T = 8: (160, -3.33)  
- At T = 9: (180, -1.67)  
- At T = 10: (200, 0)

### Detailed Positions:
- T = 0: (0, 0)  
- T = 1: (20, -1.67)  
- T = 2: (40, -3.33)  
- T = 3: (60, -5)  
- T = 4: (80, -5)  
- T = 5: (100, -5)  
- T = 6: (120, -5)  
- T = 7: (140, -5)  
- T = 8: (160, -3.33)  
- T = 9: (180, -1.67)  
- T = 10: (200, 0)

### Explanation:
1. **Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 3):** The vehicle smoothly transitions to the left lane over 3 seconds while maintaining a speed of 20 m/s.  
2. **Passing the Obstacle (T = 3 to T = 7):** The vehicle stays in the left lane and passes the obstacle at X = 100.  
3. **Returning to the Right Lane (T = 7 to T = 10):** The vehicle smoothly transitions back to the right lane over 3 seconds.  

This trajectory ensures the vehicle maintains a safe speed, avoids the obstacle, and completes the maneuver smoothly.
