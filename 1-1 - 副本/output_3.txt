To plan a safe and smooth trajectory for the double lane change maneuver, we need to ensure the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h while transitioning from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -5), passing the obstacle at X = 100, and then returning to the right lane. Here¡¯s the step-by-step trajectory:

---

### Assumptions:
1. The vehicle¡¯s initial speed is **72 km/h (20 m/s)**.
2. The maneuver should be completed within **10 seconds**.
3. The lane width is **5 meters** (Y = -5 for the left lane).
4. The obstacle is at **X = 100 meters**.
5. The vehicle accelerates or decelerates smoothly to maintain a speed above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).

### Trajectory Plan:
1. **Lane Change to the Left Lane (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)**:
   - Gradually transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds.
   - Maintain a speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s).

2. **Passing the Obstacle (T = 3 to T = 7 seconds)**:
   - Stay in the left lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstacle at X = 100.
   - Maintain a speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s).

3. **Lane Change Back to the Right Lane (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds)**:
   - Gradually transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.
   - Maintain a speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s).

### Detailed Trajectory (X, Y) at Each Timepoint:

1. **T = 0 seconds**:  
   - Position: (0, 0)  
   - Speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s)  

2. **T = 1 second**:  
   - X = 20 m (20 m/s ¡Á 1 s)  
   - Y = -1.67 m (transitioning to the left lane)  
   - Position: (20, -1.67)  

3. **T = 2 seconds**:  
   - X = 40 m  
   - Y = -3.33 m  
   - Position: (40, -3.33)  

4. **T = 3 seconds**:  
   - X = 60 m  
   - Y = -5 m (fully in the left lane)  
   - Position: (60, -5)  

5. **T = 4 seconds**:  
   - X = 80 m  
   - Y = -5 m  
   - Position: (80, -5)  

6. **T = 5 seconds**:  
   - X = 100 m  
   - Y = -5 m (passing the obstacle)  
   - Position: (100, -5)  

7. **T = 6 seconds**:  
   - X = 120 m  
   - Y = -5 m  
   - Position: (120, -5)  

8. **T = 7 seconds**:  
   - X = 140 m  
   - Y = -3.33 m (transitioning back to the right lane)  
   - Position: (140, -3.33)  

9. **T = 8 seconds**:  
   - X = 160 m  
   - Y = -1.67 m  
   - Position: (160, -1.67)  

10. **T = 9 seconds**:  
    - X = 180 m  
    - Y = 0 m (fully back in the right lane)  
    - Position: (180, 0)  

11. **T = 10 seconds**:  
    - X = 200 m  
    - Y = 0 m  
    - Position: (200, 0)

### Summary:
- The vehicle changes lanes smoothly, passes the obstacle at X = 100 while staying in the left lane, and returns to the right lane within 10 seconds.
- The speed remains constant at 72 km/h throughout the maneuver.
