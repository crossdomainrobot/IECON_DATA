To plan a safe trajectory for the double lane change maneuver, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Accelerate or maintain speed**: Ensure the vehicle stays above 60 km/h.
2. **Change to the left lane**: Move from \(Y = 0\) to \(Y = -5\).
3. **Pass the obstacle**: Stay in the left lane while passing \(X = 100\).
4. **Return to the right lane**: Move from \(Y = -5\) back to \(Y = 0\).

Let¡¯s break this down step-by-step over the next 10 seconds. Assume the vehicle maintains a constant speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) throughout the maneuver.

### Trajectory Plan:
- **T = 0 s**: Initial position \((X, Y) = (0, 0)\).
- **T = 0 to T = 2 s**: Begin changing lanes to the left. Move from \(Y = 0\) to \(Y = -5\).
- **T = 2 to T = 6 s**: Stay in the left lane (\(Y = -5\)) while passing the obstacle at \(X = 100\).
- **T = 6 to T = 8 s**: Begin changing lanes back to the right. Move from \(Y = -5\) to \(Y = 0\).
- **T = 8 to T = 10 s**: Continue driving in the right lane (\(Y = 0\)).

### Position at Each Timepoint:
1. **T = 0 s**: \((0, 0)\)
2. **T = 1 s**: \((20, -1.25)\) (transitioning to the left lane)
3. **T = 2 s**: \((40, -5)\) (fully in the left lane)
4. **T = 3 s**: \((60, -5)\) (passing the obstacle)
5. **T = 4 s**: \((80, -5)\) (passing the obstacle)
6. **T = 5 s**: \((100, -5)\) (passing the obstacle)
7. **T = 6 s**: \((120, -5)\) (still in the left lane)
8. **T = 7 s**: \((140, -2.5)\) (transitioning back to the right lane)
9. **T = 8 s**: \((160, 0)\) (fully in the right lane)
10. **T = 9 s**: \((180, 0)\) (continuing in the right lane)
11. **T = 10 s**: \((200, 0)\) (continuing in the right lane)

### Explanation:
- **Lane Change Timing**: The lane change takes 2 seconds in each direction, ensuring smooth and safe transitions.
- **Obstacle Clearance**: The vehicle stays in the left lane (\(Y = -5\)) from \(T = 2\) s to \(T = 6\) s, safely passing the obstacle at \(X = 100\).
- **Speed**: The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) throughout the maneuver.

This trajectory ensures the vehicle safely passes the obstacle while adhering to highway speed requirements.
