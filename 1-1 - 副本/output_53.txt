To plan the trajectory for the double lane change maneuver, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Initial Lane Change to the Left Lane**: Move from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -5).
2. **Pass the Obstacle**: Stay in the left lane while passing the obstacle at X = 100.
3. **Return to the Right Lane**: Move back to the right lane (Y = 0) after passing the obstacle.

Given the initial speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s), we need to ensure that the vehicle's speed remains above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s) throughout the maneuver.

### Assumptions:
- The vehicle accelerates or decelerates smoothly.
- The lane change takes approximately 2 seconds to complete (1 second to move to the left lane and 1 second to return to the right lane).
- The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) during the lane change.

### Trajectory Calculation:

#### Time Points:
- **T = 0 s**: Initial position (0, 0).
- **T = 1 s**: Start moving to the left lane.
- **T = 2 s**: Fully in the left lane (Y = -5).
- **T = 3 s to T = 5 s**: Continue driving in the left lane, passing the obstacle at X = 100.
- **T = 6 s**: Start moving back to the right lane.
- **T = 7 s**: Fully back in the right lane (Y = 0).

#### Position at Each Time Point:

- **T = 0 s**: (0, 0)
- **T = 1 s**: (20, -2.5)  // Midway to the left lane
- **T = 2 s**: (40, -5)    // Fully in the left lane
- **T = 3 s**: (60, -5)    // Continuing in the left lane
- **T = 4 s**: (80, -5)    // Continuing in the left lane
- **T = 5 s**: (100, -5)   // Passing the obstacle
- **T = 6 s**: (120, -2.5) // Midway back to the right lane
- **T = 7 s**: (140, 0)    // Fully back in the right lane

### Summary of Positions:
- **T = 0 s**: (0, 0)
- **T = 1 s**: (20, -2.5)
- **T = 2 s**: (40, -5)
- **T = 3 s**: (60, -5)
- **T = 4 s**: (80, -5)
- **T = 5 s**: (100, -5)
- **T = 6 s**: (120, -2.5)
- **T = 7 s**: (140, 0)

This trajectory ensures that the vehicle safely changes lanes, passes the obstacle, and returns to the right lane while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
