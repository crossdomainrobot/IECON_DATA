To safely perform the double lane change maneuver, we need to plan a smooth trajectory that ensures the vehicle changes to the left lane, passes the obstacle, and returns to the right lane while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h. Here¡¯s a step-by-step plan for the vehicle's position over the next 10 seconds:

---

### Assumptions:
1. **Initial Speed**: 72 km/h (20 m/s).
2. **Left Lane Position**: \( Y = -5 \).
3. **Obstacle Position**: \( (100, 0) \).
4. **Maneuver Duration**: 10 seconds.
5. **Smooth Lane Change**: The lane change will be performed gradually over 4 seconds (2 seconds to move to the left lane and 2 seconds to return to the right lane).

---

### Trajectory Plan:
1. **From \( T = 0 \) to \( T = 2 \)**: Move from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \) (change to the left lane).
2. **From \( T = 2 \) to \( T = 8 \)**: Drive in the left lane (\( Y = -5 \)) to pass the obstacle.
3. **From \( T = 8 \) to \( T = 10 \)**: Move from \( Y = -5 \) back to \( Y = 0 \) (return to the right lane).

### Position at Each Time Point:
The vehicle¡¯s position \( (X, Y) \) is calculated based on the initial speed (20 m/s) and the lane change trajectory.

| Time \( T \) (s) | \( X \) (m)        | \( Y \) (m)       |
|------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| 0                | 0                  | 0                 |
| 1                | 20                 | -1.25             |
| 2                | 40                 | -5                |
| 3                | 60                 | -5                |
| 4                | 80                 | -5                |
| 5                | 100                | -5                |
| 6                | 120                | -5                |
| 7                | 140                | -5                |
| 8                | 160                | -2.5              |
| 9                | 180                | -1.25             |
| 10               | 200                | 0                 |

### Explanation:
1. **Lane Change (\( T = 0 \) to \( T = 2 \))**: The vehicle moves laterally from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \) while continuing to move forward at 20 m/s.
2. **Passing the Obstacle (\( T = 2 \) to \( T = 8 \))**: The vehicle remains in the left lane (\( Y = -5 \)) and passes the obstacle at \( X = 100 \).
3. **Returning to the Right Lane (\( T = 8 \) to \( T = 10 \))**: The vehicle moves laterally back to \( Y = 0 \) while continuing to move forward.

This trajectory ensures the vehicle safely passes the obstacle while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
