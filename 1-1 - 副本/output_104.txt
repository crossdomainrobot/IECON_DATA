To plan the trajectory for the vehicle to safely pass the obstacle, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Initial State**: The vehicle is at position (0, 0) with a speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s).
2. **Lane Change to the Left Lane**: The vehicle needs to move to the left lane (Y = -5) before reaching the obstacle at X = 100.
3. **Passing the Obstacle**: The vehicle must stay in the left lane while passing the obstacle at X = 100.
4. **Lane Change Back to the Right Lane**: After passing the obstacle, the vehicle should return to the right lane (Y = 0).

Let's break down the trajectory step by step for each second (T = 0 to T = 10):

### Assumptions:
- The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) throughout the maneuver.
- The lane change is smooth and takes 3 seconds to complete (from Y = 0 to Y = -5 and back to Y = 0).

### Trajectory Calculation:

1. **T = 0s**: The vehicle is at (0, 0).
2. **T = 1s**: The vehicle is at (20, 0). It starts the lane change to the left.
3. **T = 2s**: The vehicle is at (40, -1.67). (Y changes linearly from 0 to -5 over 3 seconds).
4. **T = 3s**: The vehicle is at (60, -3.33).
5. **T = 4s**: The vehicle is at (80, -5). It has fully moved to the left lane.
6. **T = 5s**: The vehicle is at (100, -5). It is passing the obstacle.
7. **T = 6s**: The vehicle is at (120, -5). It starts the lane change back to the right.
8. **T = 7s**: The vehicle is at (140, -3.33).
9. **T = 8s**: The vehicle is at (160, -1.67).
10. **T = 9s**: The vehicle is at (180, 0). It has fully returned to the right lane.
11. **T = 10s**: The vehicle is at (200, 0). The maneuver is complete.

### Detailed Positions:

| Time (s) | X Position (m) | Y Position (m) |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| 0        | 0              | 0              |
| 1        | 20             | 0              |
| 2        | 40             | -1.67          |
| 3        | 60             | -3.33          |
| 4        | 80             | -5             |
| 5        | 100            | -5             |
| 6        | 120            | -5             |
| 7        | 140            | -3.33          |
| 8        | 160            | -1.67          |
| 9        | 180            | 0              |
| 10       | 200            | 0              |

### Summary:
- **Lane Change to the Left**: Completed by T = 4s.
- **Passing the Obstacle**: At T = 5s, the vehicle is at (100, -5).
- **Lane Change Back to the Right**: Completed by T = 9s.
- **Final Position**: At T = 10s, the vehicle is at (200, 0).

This trajectory ensures that the vehicle safely passes the obstacle while maintaining a speed of 72 km/h and adhering to the lane change constraints.
