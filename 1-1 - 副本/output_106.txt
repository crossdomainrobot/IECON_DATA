Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to safely change lanes to pass a stopped vehicle on the highway. Let's break this down step by step.

### Understanding the Scenario

First, let's visualize the situation:

- **Initial Position**: My car is at (0, 0) on the right lane.
- **Obstacle**: There's a stopped vehicle at (100, 0) in the same lane.
- **Left Lane**: The left lane is at Y = -5.
- **Speed**: I'm currently driving at 72 km/h, and I need to maintain a speed over 60 km/h.

My goal is to change to the left lane, pass the obstacle, and then return to the right lane.

### Converting Speed to Meters per Second

Since we're dealing with meters and seconds, it's helpful to convert my speed from km/h to m/s.

\[ 72 \text{ km/h} = \frac{72 \times 1000}{3600} = 20 \text{ m/s} \]

So, I'm traveling at 20 meters per second.

### Determining the Time to Reach the Obstacle

The obstacle is 100 meters ahead. At 20 m/s:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{100}{20} = 5 \text{ seconds} \]

This means I have 5 seconds to complete the lane change maneuver before reaching the obstacle.

### Planning the Lane Change

To ensure safety, I need to complete the lane change before I reach the obstacle. Let's plan to change lanes in the first 3 seconds.

#### Step 1: Changing to the Left Lane (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)

At T = 0, I'm at (0, 0).

By T = 3 seconds, I need to be at Y = -5 (left lane).

Assuming a smooth transition, I'll move laterally at a constant rate.

\[ \text{Lateral speed} = \frac{-5}{3} \approx -1.67 \text{ m/s} \]

So, every second, I'll move 1.67 meters to the left in the Y direction.

Simultaneously, I'm moving forward at 20 m/s in the X direction.

Let's calculate the positions at each second:

- **T = 1s**:
  - X: 20 * 1 = 20
  - Y: 0 + (-1.67 * 1) = -1.67
  - Position: (20, -1.67)

- **T = 2s**:
  - X: 20 * 2 = 40
  - Y: 0 + (-1.67 * 2) = -3.34
  - Position: (40, -3.34)

- **T = 3s**:
  - X: 20 * 3 = 60
  - Y: 0 + (-1.67 * 3) = -5
  - Position: (60, -5)

#### Step 2: Passing the Obstacle (T = 3 to T = 5 seconds)

From T = 3s to T = 5s, I'll continue driving in the left lane.

- **T = 4s**:
  - X: 20 * 4 = 80
  - Y: -5
  - Position: (80, -5)

- **T = 5s**:
  - X: 20 * 5 = 100
  - Y: -5
  - Position: (100, -5)

At T = 5s, I'm directly alongside the obstacle in the left lane.

#### Step 3: Returning to the Right Lane (T = 5 to T = 8 seconds)

Now, I need to return to the right lane (Y = 0) over the next 3 seconds.

\[ \text{Lateral speed} = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67 \text{ m/s} \]

So, every second, I'll move 1.67 meters to the right in the Y direction.

Continuing to move forward at 20 m/s in the X direction:

- **T = 6s**:
  - X: 20 * 6 = 120
  - Y: -5 + (1.67 * 1) = -3.33
  - Position: (120, -3.33)

- **T = 7s**:
  - X: 20 * 7 = 140
  - Y: -5 + (1.67 * 2) = -1.66
  - Position: (140, -1.66)

- **T = 8s**:
  - X: 20 * 8 = 160
  - Y: -5 + (1.67 * 3) = 0
  - Position: (160, 0)

#### Step 4: Continuing in the Right Lane (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds)

After returning to the right lane, I'll continue driving straight.

- **T = 9s**:
  - X: 20 * 9 = 180
  - Y: 0
  - Position: (180, 0)

- **T = 10s**:
  - X: 20 * 10 = 200
  - Y: 0
  - Position: (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions

Here's the vehicle's position at each second from T = 0 to T = 10:

| Time (s) | X Position (m) | Y Position (m) | Coordinates (X, Y) |
|----------|----------------|----------------|---------------------|
| 0        | 0              | 0              | (0, 0)             |
| 1        | 20             | -1.67          | (20, -1.67)        |
| 2        | 40             | -3.34          | (40, -3.34)        |
| 3        | 60             | -5             | (60, -5)           |
| 4        | 80             | -5             | (80, -5)           |
| 5        | 100            | -5             | (100, -5)          |
| 6        | 120            | -3.33          | (120, -3.33)       |
| 7        | 140            | -1.66          | (140, -1.66)       |
| 8        | 160            | 0              | (160, 0)           |
| 9        | 180            | 0              | (180, 0)           |
| 10       | 200            | 0              | (200, 0)           |

### Final Answer

Based on the above calculations, here's the vehicle's position at each second during the maneuver:

- **T = 0s**: (0, 0)
- **T = 1s**: (20, -1.67)
- **T = 2s**: (40, -3.34)
- **T = 3s**: (60, -5)
- **T = 4s**: (80, -5)
- **T = 5s**: (100, -5)
- **T = 6s**: (120, -3.33)
- **T = 7s**: (140, -1.66)
- **T = 8s**: (160, 0)
- **T = 9s**: (180, 0)
- **T = 10s**: (200, 0)

This trajectory ensures that I safely change to the left lane, pass the obstacle, and return to the right lane while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
