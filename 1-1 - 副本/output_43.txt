To plan a safe trajectory for the double lane change maneuver, we need to calculate the vehicle's position over time, ensuring it stays above 60 km/h and safely switches lanes to avoid the obstacle. Here's the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Assumptions and Calculations**
1. **Initial Speed**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
2. **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.
3. **Lane Width**: Right lane is at Y = 0, left lane is at Y = -5.
4. **Obstacle Position**: (100, 0).
5. **Time Interval**: We will calculate positions every second for 10 seconds (T = 0 to T = 10).

---

### **Trajectory Plan**
1. **Lane Change to the Left (Y = -5)**:
   - Start at T = 0, position (0, 0).
   - Gradually shift to the left lane by T = 3, reaching Y = -5.
2. **Pass the Obstacle**:
   - Stay in the left lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstacle at X = 100.
3. **Lane Change Back to the Right (Y = 0)**:
   - Gradually shift back to the right lane by T = 7, reaching Y = 0.
4. **Continue Driving**:
   - Maintain speed and stay in the right lane.

### **Trajectory Table**
| Time (T) | X Position (m) | Y Position (m) | Notes                          |
|----------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| 0        | 0              | 0              | Start in the right lane.       |
| 1        | 20             | -1.67          | Begin lane change.             |
| 2        | 40             | -3.33          | Continue lane change.          |
| 3        | 60             | -5             | Fully in the left lane.        |
| 4        | 80             | -5             | Approaching the obstacle.      |
| 5        | 100            | -5             | Passing the obstacle.          |
| 6        | 120            | -3.33          | Begin lane change back.        |
| 7        | 140            | -1.67          | Continue lane change back.     |
| 8        | 160            | 0              | Fully in the right lane.       |
| 9        | 180            | 0              | Continue driving.              |
| 10       | 200            | 0              | Maneuver complete.             |

### **Explanation**
1. **X Position**: Calculated as \( X = \text{Initial Speed} \times T \).
2. **Y Position**: Smoothly transitions from 0 to -5 and back to 0 over 7 seconds for safety.
3. **Speed**: Maintained above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s) throughout the maneuver.

This trajectory ensures the vehicle safely avoids the obstacle while adhering to highway speed limits.
