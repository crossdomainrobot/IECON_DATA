To safely execute the double lane change maneuver, we need to plan a smooth trajectory that ensures the vehicle changes to the left lane, passes the obstacle, and returns to the right lane while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h. Here¡¯s a step-by-step plan with positions at 1-second intervals (T = 1, 2, ..., 10):

---

### **Given:**
- **Initial position:** (0, 0)  
- **Obstacle position:** (100, 0)  
- **Left lane Y-coordinate:** -5  
- **Initial speed:** 72 km/h (20 m/s)  
- **Minimum speed:** 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)  
- **Time interval:** 1 second

### **Steps:**
1. **Change to the left lane** (Y = -5) smoothly over 2 seconds.  
2. **Maintain the left lane** while passing the obstacle (X = 100).  
3. **Return to the right lane** (Y = 0) smoothly over 2 seconds.

| T = 0        | 0                 | 0                 | Initial position, right lane.                                                  |
| T = 1        | 20                | -1.25             | Start lane change to the left.                                                 |
| T = 2        | 40                | -5                | Fully in the left lane.                                                        |
| T = 3        | 60                | -5                | Continue in the left lane.                                                     |
| T = 4        | 80                | -5                | Continue in the left lane.                                                     |
| T = 5        | 100               | -5                | Pass the obstacle in the left lane.                                            |
| T = 6        | 120               | -3.75             | Start lane change back to the right.                                           |
| T = 7        | 140               | -1.25             | Continue lane change back to the right.                                        |
| T = 8        | 160               | 0                 | Fully in the right lane.                                                       |

### **Explanation:**
1. **Lane Change to the Left (T = 0 to T = 2):**  
   - The vehicle moves laterally from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds while maintaining a speed of 20 m/s.  
   - X increases by 20 m each second.  

2. **Passing the Obstacle (T = 2 to T = 5):**  
   - The vehicle stays in the left lane (Y = -5) and continues moving forward at 20 m/s.  
   - At T = 5, the vehicle reaches X = 100, passing the obstacle.  

3. **Lane Change Back to the Right (T = 5 to T = 8):**  
   - The vehicle moves laterally from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds while maintaining a speed of 20 m/s.  
   - X increases by 20 m each second.  

4. **Continue in the Right Lane (T = 8 to T = 10):**  
   - The vehicle stays in the right lane (Y = 0) and continues moving forward at 20 m/s.

This trajectory ensures the vehicle safely passes the obstacle while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
