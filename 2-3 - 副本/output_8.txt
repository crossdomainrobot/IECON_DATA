To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):**  
   Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) smoothly.  
2. **Bypass the Obstruction (X = 100):**  
   Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstruction.  
3. **Return to the Original Lane (Y = 0):**  
   Transition back to the outer lane (Y = 0) after bypassing the obstruction.

### Assumptions:
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.  
- Speed must exceed 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s throughout.  
- Lane change duration: 2 seconds (1 second to move laterally, 1 second to stabilize).  
- Obstruction is at X = 100 meters.  
- Time step: 1 second.

### Route Planning:

#### Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2)
- **T = 0:** (X = 0, Y = 0)  
  Start at the origin.  
- **T = 1:** (X = 20, Y = -2.5)  
  Halfway through the lane change.  
- **T = 2:** (X = 40, Y = -5)  
  Fully transitioned to the adjacent lane.

#### Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)
- **T = 3:** (X = 60, Y = -5)  
  Continue in the adjacent lane.  
- **T = 4:** (X = 80, Y = -5)  
  Approaching the obstruction.  
- **T = 5:** (X = 100, Y = -5)  
  At the obstruction, bypassing it.  
- **T = 6:** (X = 120, Y = -5)  
  Past the obstruction, still in the adjacent lane.

#### Phase 3: Return to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)
- **T = 7:** (X = 140, Y = -2.5)  
  Halfway through returning to the original lane.  
- **T = 8:** (X = 160, Y = 0)  
  Fully returned to the outer lane.

#### Final Phase: Continue in the Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)
- **T = 9:** (X = 180, Y = 0)  
  Continue straight.  
- **T = 10:** (X = 200, Y = 0)  
  Continue straight.

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |  
| 2        | 40    | -5    |  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    |  
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |  
| 8        | 160   | 0     |  
| 9        | 180   | 0     |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |  

### Key Points:
- The lane change is completed by T = 2.  
- The obstruction is bypassed at T = 5.  
- The return to the original lane is completed by T = 8.  
- Speed remains constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h), satisfying the requirement of exceeding 60 km/h.
