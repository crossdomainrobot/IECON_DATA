To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:  
1. **Transition to the adjacent lane** (Y = -5).  
2. **Bypass the obstruction** (X = 100) while staying in the adjacent lane.  
3. **Return to the original lane** (Y = 0).  

### Assumptions:  
- Initial velocity: \( 72 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \).  
- Speed must exceed \( 60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \).  
- Lane transition (Y) takes 2 seconds (smooth lateral movement).  
- The obstruction is at \( X = 100 \, \text{m} \).  
- Time step: \( T = 1 \, \text{second} \).  

### Phase 1: Transition to the Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2)  
- At \( T = 0 \): Position = \( (0, 0) \).  
- At \( T = 1 \): Move laterally to \( Y = -2.5 \), while traveling forward at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).  
  \( X = 20 \), \( Y = -2.5 \).  
- At \( T = 2 \): Complete the lane transition to \( Y = -5 \), while traveling forward.  
  \( X = 40 \), \( Y = -5 \).  

### Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)  
- At \( T = 3 \): Continue in the adjacent lane.  
  \( X = 60 \), \( Y = -5 \).  
- At \( T = 4 \): Continue in the adjacent lane.  
  \( X = 80 \), \( Y = -5 \).  
- At \( T = 5 \): Continue in the adjacent lane.  
  \( X = 100 \), \( Y = -5 \).  
- At \( T = 6 \): Continue in the adjacent lane.  
  \( X = 120 \), \( Y = -5 \).  

### Phase 3: Return to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)  
- At \( T = 7 \): Begin transitioning back to \( Y = 0 \).  
  \( X = 140 \), \( Y = -2.5 \).  
- At \( T = 8 \): Complete the transition to \( Y = 0 \).  
  \( X = 160 \), \( Y = 0 \).  

### Final Positions:  
- \( T = 0 \): \( (0, 0) \)  
- \( T = 1 \): \( (20, -2.5) \)  
- \( T = 2 \): \( (40, -5) \)  
- \( T = 3 \): \( (60, -5) \)  
- \( T = 4 \): \( (80, -5) \)  
- \( T = 5 \): \( (100, -5) \)  
- \( T = 6 \): \( (120, -5) \)  
- \( T = 7 \): \( (140, -2.5) \)  
- \( T = 8 \): \( (160, 0) \)  

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above \( 60 \, \text{km/h} \).
