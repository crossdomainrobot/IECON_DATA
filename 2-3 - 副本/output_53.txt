To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**  

### Assumptions:
- Initial velocity: \( 72 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- Minimum speed: \( 60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- Lane width: \( 5 \, \text{m} \) (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane)  
- Obstruction at \( X = 100 \, \text{m} \)  

### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)
- Time for lane change: Assume \( 2 \, \text{seconds} \) (smooth transition).  
- During this phase, the vehicle moves laterally from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \) while maintaining speed.  

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)
- The vehicle stays in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until it clears the obstruction at \( X = 100 \, \text{m} \).  

### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)
- Time for lane change: Assume \( 2 \, \text{seconds} \) (smooth transition).  
- The vehicle moves laterally from \( Y = -5 \) to \( Y = 0 \) while maintaining speed.  

### Position Estimates:
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals.  

#### Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2)
- Lateral movement: \( Y \) transitions linearly from 0 to -5 over 2 seconds.  
- Longitudinal movement: \( X \) increases at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |  
| 2        | 40    | -5    |  

#### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)
- The vehicle stays in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) and continues moving forward at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    |  

#### Phase 3: Lane Change Back (T = 6 to T = 8)
- Lateral movement: \( Y \) transitions linearly from -5 to 0 over 2 seconds.  
- Longitudinal movement: \( X \) increases at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |  
| 8        | 160   | 0     |  

#### Final Phase: Continuing in the Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)
- The vehicle stays in the original lane (Y = 0) and continues moving forward at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 9        | 180   | 0     |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |  

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |  
| 2        | 40    | -5    |  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    |  
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |  
| 8        | 160   | 0     |  
| 9        | 180   | 0     |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |  

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above \( 60 \, \text{km/h} \).
