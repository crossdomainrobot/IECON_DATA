To navigate around the obstruction while maintaining a speed exceeding 60 km/h, we¡¯ll plan the vehicle¡¯s trajectory step by step. Here¡¯s the route planning:

### Key Assumptions:
1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - Starting position: \((X, Y) = (0, 0)\).
   - Speed: \(72 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s}\).
   - Obstruction: Located at \((100, 0)\).
   - Adjacent lane: \(Y = -5\).

2. **Constraints**:
   - Speed must exceed \(60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s}\).
   - Lane transitions must be smooth and safe.

3. **Time Intervals**:
   - We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position every second for 10 seconds.

### Route Planning:
1. **Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2)**:
   - Move from \(Y = 0\) to \(Y = -5\) over 2 seconds.
   - Lateral velocity: \( \frac{-5 \, \text{m}}{2 \, \text{s}} = -2.5 \, \text{m/s} \).
   - Longitudinal velocity: \(20 \, \text{m/s}\).

2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)**:
   - Stay in the adjacent lane (\(Y = -5\)) while bypassing the obstruction at \(X = 100\).
   - Longitudinal velocity: \(20 \, \text{m/s}\).

3. **Returning to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)**:
   - Move from \(Y = -5\) to \(Y = 0\) over 2 seconds.
   - Lateral velocity: \( \frac{5 \, \text{m}}{2 \, \text{s}} = 2.5 \, \text{m/s} \).
   - Longitudinal velocity: \(20 \, \text{m/s}\).

4. **Continuing in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)**:
   - Stay in the original lane (\(Y = 0\)) and continue at \(20 \, \text{m/s}\).

### Position Estimates:
| Time (s) | \(X\) (m) | \(Y\) (m) |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 0        | 0         | 0         |
| 1        | 20        | -2.5      |
| 2        | 40        | -5        |
| 3        | 60        | -5        |
| 4        | 80        | -5        |
| 5        | 100       | -5        |
| 6        | 120       | -5        |
| 7        | 140       | -2.5      |
| 8        | 160       | 0         |
| 9        | 180       | 0         |
| 10       | 200       | 0         |

### Explanation:
1. **Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2)**:
   - The vehicle moves laterally to the adjacent lane while maintaining a longitudinal speed of \(20 \, \text{m/s}\).

2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)**:
   - The vehicle stays in the adjacent lane (\(Y = -5\)) and bypasses the obstruction at \(X = 100\).

3. **Returning to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)**:
   - The vehicle moves back to the original lane (\(Y = 0\)) while maintaining a longitudinal speed of \(20 \, \text{m/s}\).

4. **Continuing in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)**:
   - The vehicle continues in the original lane at \(20 \, \text{m/s}\).

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed exceeding \(60 \, \text{km/h}\) and safely navigates around the obstruction.
