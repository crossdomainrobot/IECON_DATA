To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the task into phases: **lane transition**, **bypassing the obstruction**, and **returning to the original lane**. We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals, ensuring the speed remains above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s) throughout.

### Given:
- **Initial position**: (0, 0)
- **Obstruction position**: (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5
- **Initial velocity**: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)

### Assumptions:
1. The lane transition takes **3 seconds** (smooth and gradual).
2. The bypass maneuver occurs between X = 90 m and X = 110 m.
3. The return to the original lane takes **3 seconds** after bypassing the obstruction.

### Calculations:
1. **Lane Transition (0 ¡Ü T ¡Ü 3)**:
   - X increases linearly: \( X(T) = 20 \cdot T \)
   - Y transitions linearly from 0 to -5: \( Y(T) = -\frac{5}{3} \cdot T \)

2. **Bypassing Obstruction (3 < T ¡Ü 6)**:
   - X continues linearly: \( X(T) = 20 \cdot T \)
   - Y remains constant at -5.

3. **Return to Original Lane (6 < T ¡Ü 9)**:
   - X continues linearly: \( X(T) = 20 \cdot T \)
   - Y transitions linearly from -5 to 0: \( Y(T) = -5 + \frac{5}{3} \cdot (T - 6) \)

4. **Continue in Original Lane (T > 9)**:
   - X continues linearly: \( X(T) = 20 \cdot T \)
   - Y remains constant at 0.

### Vehicle Positions at 1-second Intervals:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m)     |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| T = 0    | 0     | 0         |
| T = 1    | 20    | -1.67     |
| T = 2    | 40    | -3.33     |
| T = 3    | 60    | -5        |
| T = 4    | 80    | -5        |
| T = 5    | 100   | -5        |
| T = 6    | 120   | -5        |
| T = 7    | 140   | -3.33     |
| T = 8    | 160   | -1.67     |
| T = 9    | 180   | 0         |
| T = 10   | 200   | 0         |

### Explanation:
- **Lane Transition (T = 0 to 3)**: The vehicle moves from Y = 0 to Y = -5 while maintaining a constant speed of 20 m/s.
- **Bypassing Obstruction (T = 3 to 6)**: The vehicle stays in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) and passes the obstruction at X = 100 m.
- **Return to Original Lane (T = 6 to 9)**: The vehicle transitions back to Y = 0 while maintaining speed.
- **Continue in Original Lane (T > 9)**: The vehicle remains in the original lane (Y = 0) and continues traveling at 20 m/s.

This plan ensures the vehicle avoids the obstruction, maintains a speed above 60 km/h, and completes the maneuver safely.
