To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Returning to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**  

### Assumptions:
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane)  
- Obstruction at X = 100 meters  

### Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)
- Time to change lanes: 2 seconds (smooth transition)  
- Lateral movement: From Y = 0 to Y = -5  
- Distance traveled: 20 m/s ¡Á 2 s = 40 meters  

**Positions:**
- T = 1 s: (20, -2.5)  
- T = 2 s: (40, -5)  

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6 seconds)
- Maintain speed: 20 m/s  
- Distance traveled: 20 m/s ¡Á 4 s = 80 meters  
- Total X at T = 6 s: 40 + 80 = 120 meters (bypassing X = 100)  

**Positions:**
- T = 3 s: (60, -5)  
- T = 4 s: (80, -5)  
- T = 5 s: (100, -5)  
- T = 6 s: (120, -5)  

### Phase 3: Returning to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)
- Time to change lanes: 2 seconds  
- Lateral movement: From Y = -5 to Y = 0  
- Distance traveled: 20 m/s ¡Á 2 s = 40 meters  

**Positions:**
- T = 7 s: (140, -2.5)  
- T = 8 s: (160, 0)  

### Final Phase: Continuing in the Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds)
- Maintain speed: 20 m/s  
- Distance traveled: 20 m/s ¡Á 2 s = 40 meters  

**Positions:**
- T = 9 s: (180, 0)  
- T = 10 s: (200, 0)  

### Summary of Positions:
- T = 1 s: (20, -2.5)  
- T = 2 s: (40, -5)  
- T = 3 s: (60, -5)  
- T = 4 s: (80, -5)  
- T = 5 s: (100, -5)  
- T = 6 s: (120, -5)  
- T = 7 s: (140, -2.5)  
- T = 8 s: (160, 0)  
- T = 9 s: (180, 0)  
- T = 10 s: (200, 0)  

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
