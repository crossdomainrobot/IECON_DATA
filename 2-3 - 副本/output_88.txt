To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into phases:  
1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane** (Y = -5).  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction** (X = 100).  
3. **Returning to the Original Lane** (Y = 0).  

### Assumptions:  
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).  
- Obstruction at X = 100 meters.  
- Time step: 1 second.  

### Route Planning:  
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at each second (T = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10).  

#### Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2)  
- **T = 0**: Start at (0, 0).  
- **T = 1**: Begin lane change. Move to (20, -2.5).  
- **T = 2**: Complete lane change. Move to (40, -5).  

#### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)  
- **T = 3**: Continue in the adjacent lane. Move to (60, -5).  
- **T = 4**: Continue in the adjacent lane. Move to (80, -5).  
- **T = 5**: Continue in the adjacent lane. Move to (100, -5).  
- **T = 6**: Continue in the adjacent lane. Move to (120, -5).  

#### Phase 3: Returning to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)  
- **T = 7**: Begin lane change. Move to (140, -2.5).  
- **T = 8**: Complete lane change. Move to (160, 0).  

#### Phase 4: Continue in the Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)  
- **T = 9**: Continue in the original lane. Move to (180, 0).  
- **T = 10**: Continue in the original lane. Move to (200, 0).  

### Summary of Positions:  
| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| 0        | (0, 0)          |  
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |  
| 2        | (40, -5)        |  
| 3        | (60, -5)        |  
| 4        | (80, -5)        |  
| 5        | (100, -5)       |  
| 6        | (120, -5)       |  
| 7        | (140, -2.5)     |  
| 8        | (160, 0)        |  
| 9        | (180, 0)        |  
| 10       | (200, 0)        |  

### Key Points:  
- The lane change is completed by T = 2.  
- The obstruction is bypassed by T = 5.  
- The vehicle returns to the original lane by T = 8.  
- Speed is maintained above 60 km/h throughout.  

This plan ensures a smooth and safe maneuver around the obstruction.
