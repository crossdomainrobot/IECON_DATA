To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the vehicle's movement into critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. The vehicle starts at (0, 0) with an initial velocity of 72 km/h (20 m/s) and must maintain a speed exceeding 60 km/h (16.67 m/s). The adjacent lane is at Y = -5, and the obstruction is at (100, 0).

### Assumptions:
1. The vehicle accelerates or decelerates smoothly to change lanes.
2. The lane change takes approximately 2 seconds (a typical duration for a safe lane change).
3. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s during the lane change.
4. The vehicle returns to the original lane after bypassing the obstruction.

### Step-by-Step Plan:

#### 1. **Initial Movement (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds):**
   - The vehicle starts at (0, 0) and begins to transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
   - The lane change takes 2 seconds, so by T = 2 seconds, the vehicle is at Y = -5.
   - During this time, the vehicle travels forward at 20 m/s.
   - Distance traveled: \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \times 2 \, \text{s} = 40 \, \text{m} \).
   - Position at T = 2 seconds: (40, -5).

#### 2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6 seconds):**
   - The vehicle continues in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) to bypass the obstruction at (100, 0).
   - The vehicle travels from X = 40 to X = 100 at 20 m/s.
   - Distance to cover: \( 100 - 40 = 60 \, \text{m} \).
   - Time taken: \( 60 \, \text{m} / 20 \, \text{m/s} = 3 \, \text{s} \).
   - Position at T = 5 seconds: (100, -5).

#### 3. **Returning to the Original Lane (T = 5 to T = 7 seconds):**
   - The vehicle begins to transition back to the original lane (Y = 0).
   - The lane change takes 2 seconds, so by T = 7 seconds, the vehicle is at Y = 0.
   - During this time, the vehicle travels forward at 20 m/s.
   - Distance traveled: \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \times 2 \, \text{s} = 40 \, \text{m} \).
   - Position at T = 7 seconds: (140, 0).

#### 4. **Continuing in the Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds):**
   - The vehicle continues in the original lane (Y = 0) at 20 m/s.
   - Distance traveled: \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \times 3 \, \text{s} = 60 \, \text{m} \).
   - Position at T = 10 seconds: (200, 0).

### Summary of Positions at Critical Intervals:

| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|-----------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |
| 2        | (40, -5)        |
| 3        | (60, -5)        |
| 4        | (80, -5)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -2.5)     |
| 7        | (140, 0)        |
| 8        | (160, 0)        |
| 9        | (180, 0)        |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

### Explanation:
- **T = 1 second:** The vehicle is halfway through the lane change, so Y = -2.5.
- **T = 6 seconds:** The vehicle is halfway through returning to the original lane, so Y = -2.5.
- **T = 7 to T = 10 seconds:** The vehicle continues in the original lane at a constant speed.

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
