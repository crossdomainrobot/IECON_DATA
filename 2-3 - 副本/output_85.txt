To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into phases: **lane change to the adjacent lane**, **bypassing the obstruction**, and **returning to the original lane**. We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals, ensuring the speed remains above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).

### Assumptions:
- **Initial position**: (0, 0)
- **Obstruction position**: (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5
- **Initial velocity**: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- **Time step**: 1 second

### Phases:
1. **Lane change to the adjacent lane (Y = -5)**:
   - Assume the lane change takes 3 seconds.
   - Lateral movement: From Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds.
   - Longitudinal movement: Constant speed of 20 m/s.

2. **Bypassing the obstruction (X = 100)**:
   - Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until X > 100.

3. **Returning to the original lane (Y = 0)**:
   - Assume the lane change takes 3 seconds.
   - Lateral movement: From Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.
   - Longitudinal movement: Constant speed of 20 m/s.

### Calculations:
#### Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 3)
- **Lateral movement**: Y = -5/3 * T (linear interpolation)
- **Longitudinal movement**: X = 20 * T

| T (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 0     | 0     | 0     |
| 1     | 20    | -1.67 |
| 2     | 40    | -3.33 |
| 3     | 60    | -5    |

#### Phase 2: Bypassing Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7)
- **Lateral movement**: Y = -5 (constant)
- **Longitudinal movement**: X = 60 + 20 * (T - 3)

| T (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 3     | 60    | -5    |
| 4     | 80    | -5    |
| 5     | 100   | -5    |
| 6     | 120   | -5    |
| 7     | 140   | -5    |

#### Phase 3: Returning to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10)
- **Lateral movement**: Y = -5 + 5/3 * (T - 7) (linear interpolation)
- **Longitudinal movement**: X = 140 + 20 * (T - 7)

| T (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 7     | 140   | -5    |
| 8     | 160   | -3.33 |
| 9     | 180   | -1.67 |
| 10    | 200   | 0     |

### Summary of Positions:
| T (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 0     | 0     | 0     |
| 1     | 20    | -1.67 |
| 2     | 40    | -3.33 |
| 3     | 60    | -5    |
| 4     | 80    | -5    |
| 5     | 100   | -5    |
| 6     | 120   | -5    |
| 7     | 140   | -5    |
| 8     | 160   | -3.33 |
| 9     | 180   | -1.67 |
| 10    | 200   | 0     |

### Key Points:
- The vehicle successfully bypasses the obstruction at X = 100 while maintaining a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h).
- The lane changes are smooth and completed within 3 seconds each.
- The speed remains above the minimum requirement of 16.67 m/s (60 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
