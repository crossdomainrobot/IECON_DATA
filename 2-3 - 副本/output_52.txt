To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the vehicle's movement into critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. The vehicle starts at (0, 0) with an initial velocity of 72 km/h (20 m/s). The adjacent lane is at Y = -5, and the obstruction is at (100, 0). We'll assume the vehicle transitions smoothly to the adjacent lane, bypasses the obstruction, and returns to the original lane.

### Key Assumptions:
1. **Lane Transition Time**: We'll assume it takes 2 seconds to transition from one lane to the adjacent lane (Y = 0 to Y = -5 or vice versa).
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction**: The vehicle will stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while bypassing the obstruction at X = 100.
3. **Speed**: The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.

### Step-by-Step Plan:

1. **T = 0 to T = 2 seconds**: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
   - **X-coordinate**: The vehicle moves forward at 20 m/s. In 2 seconds, it travels 40 meters.
   - **Y-coordinate**: The vehicle transitions linearly from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
   - **Position at T = 2 seconds**: (40, -5)

2. **T = 2 to T = 5 seconds**: Continue in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) to bypass the obstruction.
   - **X-coordinate**: The vehicle continues to move forward at 20 m/s. From T = 2 to T = 5, it travels an additional 60 meters.
   - **Position at T = 5 seconds**: (100, -5)

3. **T = 5 to T = 7 seconds**: Transition back from Y = -5 to Y = 0.
   - **X-coordinate**: The vehicle continues to move forward at 20 m/s. In 2 seconds, it travels 40 meters.
   - **Y-coordinate**: The vehicle transitions linearly from Y = -5 to Y = 0.
   - **Position at T = 7 seconds**: (140, 0)

4. **T = 7 to T = 10 seconds**: Continue in the original lane (Y = 0).
   - **X-coordinate**: The vehicle continues to move forward at 20 m/s. From T = 7 to T = 10, it travels an additional 60 meters.
   - **Position at T = 10 seconds**: (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions at Critical Intervals:
- **T = 0 seconds**: (0, 0)
- **T = 1 second**: (20, -2.5)  (Midway in the first lane transition)
- **T = 2 seconds**: (40, -5)
- **T = 3 seconds**: (60, -5)
- **T = 4 seconds**: (80, -5)
- **T = 5 seconds**: (100, -5)
- **T = 6 seconds**: (120, -2.5)  (Midway in the second lane transition)
- **T = 7 seconds**: (140, 0)
- **T = 8 seconds**: (160, 0)
- **T = 9 seconds**: (180, 0)
- **T = 10 seconds**: (200, 0)

### Conclusion:
By following this plan, the vehicle successfully navigates around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h. The lane transitions are smooth, and the vehicle returns to its original lane after bypassing the obstruction.
