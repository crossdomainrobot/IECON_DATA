To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Returning to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**  

### Assumptions:
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane)  
- Obstruction is at (100, 0)  
- Time step: 1 second  

### Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)
- **T = 0**: Start at (0, 0)  
- **T = 1**: Move to (20, -2.5) (halfway into the lane change)  
- **T = 2**: Complete lane change at (40, -5)  

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6 seconds)
- **T = 3**: (60, -5)  
- **T = 4**: (80, -5)  
- **T = 5**: (100, -5) (bypass the obstruction)  
- **T = 6**: (120, -5)  

### Phase 3: Returning to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)
- **T = 7**: (140, -2.5) (halfway back to the original lane)  
- **T = 8**: (160, 0) (back in the original lane)  

### Final Positions:
- **T = 9**: (180, 0)  
- **T = 10**: (200, 0)  

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| 0        | (0, 0)          |  
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |  
| 2        | (40, -5)        |  
| 3        | (60, -5)        |  
| 4        | (80, -5)        |  
| 5        | (100, -5)       |  
| 6        | (120, -5)       |  
| 7        | (140, -2.5)     |  
| 8        | (160, 0)        |  
| 9        | (180, 0)        |  
| 10       | (200, 0)        |  

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h while safely navigating around the obstruction.
