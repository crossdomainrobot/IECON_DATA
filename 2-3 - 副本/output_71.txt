To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll divide the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):**  
   - Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
   - Assume this takes 2 seconds.

2. **Bypassing the Obstruction:**  
   - Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstruction (X = 100).  
   - This phase lasts until the vehicle is safely past the obstruction.

3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0):**  
   - Transition back to the outer lane (Y = 0).  
   - Assume this takes 2 seconds.

### Key Parameters:
- **Initial Velocity:** 72 km/h = 20 m/s.  
- **Minimum Speed:** 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.  
- **Obstruction Location:** (X, Y) = (100, 0).  
- **Adjacent Lane:** Y = -5.

### Route Planning:
#### Phase 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2)  
- **Lateral Motion:** Move from Y = 0 to Y = -5 in 2 seconds.  
  - Lateral velocity: \( \frac{-5}{2} = -2.5 \, \text{m/s} \).  
- **Longitudinal Motion:** Maintain speed of 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m)      | Y (m)       |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| T = 0    | 0          | 0           |
| T = 1    | 20         | -2.5        |
| T = 2    | 40         | -5          |

---

#### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 7)  
- **Lateral Motion:** Stay at Y = -5.  
- **Longitudinal Motion:** Maintain speed of 20 m/s.  
- **Obstruction:** At X = 100, T = 5 seconds.  

| Time (s) | X (m)      | Y (m)       |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| T = 3    | 60         | -5          |
| T = 4    | 80         | -5          |
| T = 5    | 100        | -5          |
| T = 6    | 120        | -5          |
| T = 7    | 140        | -5          |

---

#### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 9)  
- **Lateral Motion:** Move from Y = -5 to Y = 0 in 2 seconds.  
  - Lateral velocity: \( \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \, \text{m/s} \).  
- **Longitudinal Motion:** Maintain speed of 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m)      | Y (m)       |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| T = 8    | 160        | -2.5        |
| T = 9    | 180        | 0           |

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | X (m)      | Y (m)       |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| T = 0    | 0          | 0           |
| T = 1    | 20         | -2.5        |
| T = 2    | 40         | -5          |
| T = 3    | 60         | -5          |
| T = 4    | 80         | -5          |
| T = 5    | 100        | -5          |
| T = 6    | 120        | -5          |
| T = 7    | 140        | -5          |
| T = 8    | 160        | -2.5        |
| T = 9    | 180        | 0           |

### Notes:
- The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout, satisfying the minimum speed requirement.  
- The obstruction is bypassed safely at T = 5 seconds.  
- The lane transitions are smooth and completed within the 10-second timeframe.
