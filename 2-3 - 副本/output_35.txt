To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):**  
   Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
2. **Bypass the Obstruction (X = 100):**  
   Stay in the adjacent lane while passing the obstruction.  
3. **Return to the Original Lane (Y = 0):**  
   Transition back to the outer lane after bypassing the obstruction.

### Assumptions:
- Vehicle speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s).  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).  
- Obstruction is at X = 100 meters.  
- Lane changes take 2 seconds each (smooth transition).  
- Speed remains constant at 20 m/s throughout.

### Critical Intervals:
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at 1-second intervals (T = 0 to T = 10).

---

### Phase 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2)
- **T = 0:** (X = 0, Y = 0)  
- **T = 1:** (X = 20, Y = -2.5)  
- **T = 2:** (X = 40, Y = -5)  

---

### Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)
- **T = 3:** (X = 60, Y = -5)  
- **T = 4:** (X = 80, Y = -5)  
- **T = 5:** (X = 100, Y = -5)  
- **T = 6:** (X = 120, Y = -5)  

---

### Phase 3: Return to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)
- **T = 7:** (X = 140, Y = -2.5)  
- **T = 8:** (X = 160, Y = 0)  

---

### Final Positions (T = 9 to T = 10)
- **T = 9:** (X = 180, Y = 0)  
- **T = 10:** (X = 200, Y = 0)  

---

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |  
| 2        | 40    | -5    |  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    |  
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |  
| 8        | 160   | 0     |  
| 9        | 180   | 0     |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |  

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed of 72 km/h and completes the lane transitions smoothly.
