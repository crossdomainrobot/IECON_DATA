To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break the process into key phases: **lane transition**, **bypassing the obstruction**, and **returning to the original lane**. We'll calculate the vehicle's position at 1-second intervals, ensuring the speed remains above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).

### **Assumptions and Initial Conditions**
1. **Starting Point**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
2. **Obstruction**: Located at (100, 0)
3. **Adjacent Lane**: Y = -5
4. **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s
5. **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s
6. **Time Interval**: 1 second

### **Route Plan**
#### **Phase 1: Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2)**
- **Objective**: Move from Y = 0 to Y = -5 (adjacent lane).
- **Lateral Movement**: Assume a smooth transition over 2 seconds.
- **Lateral Velocity**: ¦¤Y = -5 / 2 = -2.5 m/s
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Maintain speed of 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m)       | Y (m)       |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| T = 0    | 0           | 0           |
| T = 1    | 20          | -2.5        |
| T = 2    | 40          | -5          |

---

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)**
- **Objective**: Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstruction at X = 100.
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Continue at 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m)       | Y (m)       |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| T = 3    | 60          | -5          |
| T = 4    | 80          | -5          |
| T = 5    | 100         | -5          |
| T = 6    | 120         | -5          |

#### **Phase 3: Returning to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)**
- **Objective**: Move from Y = -5 back to Y = 0.
- **Lateral Movement**: Assume a smooth transition over 2 seconds.
- **Lateral Velocity**: ¦¤Y = 5 / 2 = 2.5 m/s
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Maintain speed of 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m)       | Y (m)       |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| T = 7    | 140         | -2.5        |
| T = 8    | 160         | 0           |

---

#### **Phase 4: Continuing in the Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)**
- **Objective**: Continue traveling in the original lane (Y = 0).
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Maintain speed of 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m)       | Y (m)       |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| T = 9    | 180         | 0           |
| T = 10   | 200         | 0           |

### **Summary of Positions**
| Time (s) | X (m)       | Y (m)       |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| T = 0    | 0           | 0           |
| T = 1    | 20          | -2.5        |
| T = 2    | 40          | -5          |
| T = 3    | 60          | -5          |
| T = 4    | 80          | -5          |
| T = 5    | 100         | -5          |
| T = 6    | 120         | -5          |
| T = 7    | 140         | -2.5        |
| T = 8    | 160         | 0           |
| T = 9    | 180         | 0           |
| T = 10   | 200         | 0           |

### **Key Points**
1. The vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane smoothly over 2 seconds.
2. It remains in the adjacent lane while bypassing the obstruction at X = 100.
3. It returns to the original lane smoothly over the next 2 seconds.
4. The speed remains constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h), satisfying the minimum speed requirement.

This plan ensures safe and efficient navigation around the obstruction.
