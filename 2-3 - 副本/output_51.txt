To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into phases and calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals. Here¡¯s the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Given Data**
- **Initial position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Obstruction position**: (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5
- **Initial velocity**: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- **Time interval**: 1 second

---

### **Assumptions**
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
2. The lane change is smooth and takes 2 seconds to transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
3. The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while bypassing the obstruction.
4. The vehicle returns to the original lane (Y = 0) after passing the obstruction.

### **Route Planning**
#### **Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2)**
- **T = 0**: (0, 0)
- **T = 1**: (20, -2.5) ¡ª Halfway through the lane change.
- **T = 2**: (40, -5) ¡ª Fully in the adjacent lane.

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 5)**
- **T = 3**: (60, -5)
- **T = 4**: (80, -5)
- **T = 5**: (100, -5) ¡ª Obstruction bypassed.

#### **Phase 3: Lane Return (T = 5 to T = 7)**
- **T = 6**: (120, -2.5) ¡ª Halfway back to the original lane.
- **T = 7**: (140, 0) ¡ª Fully back in the original lane.

#### **Phase 4: Continuing in the Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10)**
- **T = 8**: (160, 0)
- **T = 9**: (180, 0)
- **T = 10**: (200, 0)

### **Summary of Positions**
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|-----------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |
| 2        | (40, -5)        |
| 3        | (60, -5)        |
| 4        | (80, -5)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -2.5)     |
| 7        | (140, 0)        |
| 8        | (160, 0)        |
| 9        | (180, 0)        |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

### **Key Points**
- The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout.
- The lane change and return are completed smoothly within 2 seconds each.
- The obstruction is bypassed at T = 5, and the vehicle returns to the original lane by T = 7.
- The vehicle continues in the original lane after T = 7.
