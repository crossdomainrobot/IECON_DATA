To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:  
1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Returning to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**  

### Assumptions:  
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane)  
- Obstruction at X = 100 meters  
- Time step: 1 second  

### Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)  
- At T = 0: Position = (0, 0)  
- At T = 1: Move laterally to Y = -2.5 (halfway to the adjacent lane)  
- At T = 2: Move laterally to Y = -5 (fully in the adjacent lane)  
- X-coordinate increases linearly with time: X = 20 * T  

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6 seconds)  
- Maintain Y = -5 while bypassing the obstruction at X = 100  
- X-coordinate increases linearly with time: X = 20 * T  

### Phase 3: Returning to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)  
- At T = 6: Begin returning to Y = 0  
- At T = 7: Move laterally to Y = -2.5 (halfway back to the original lane)  
- At T = 8: Move laterally to Y = 0 (fully in the original lane)  
- X-coordinate increases linearly with time: X = 20 * T  

### Position Estimates:  
| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |  
| 2        | 40    | -5    |  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    |  
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |  
| 8        | 160   | 0     |  
| 9        | 180   | 0     |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |  

### Explanation:  
- The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout.  
- The lane change is completed in 2 seconds, and the return to the original lane is completed in another 2 seconds.  
- The obstruction is bypassed between T = 2 and T = 6 seconds while staying in the adjacent lane.  
- After T = 8 seconds, the vehicle continues in the original lane.  

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h and safely navigates around the obstruction.
