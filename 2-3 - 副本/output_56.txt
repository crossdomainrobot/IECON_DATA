To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:  
1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Returning to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**  

### Assumptions:  
- Initial velocity: \( 72 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- Minimum speed: \( 60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- Lane width: \( 5 \, \text{m} \) (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane)  
- Obstruction at \( X = 100 \, \text{m} \)  
- Time step: \( 1 \, \text{second} \)  

### Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2)  
- At \( T = 0 \): Position = \( (0, 0) \)  
- At \( T = 1 \): Move laterally to \( Y = -2.5 \, \text{m} \) while maintaining speed. Position = \( (20, -2.5) \)  
- At \( T = 2 \): Complete lane change to \( Y = -5 \, \text{m} \). Position = \( (40, -5) \)  

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)  
- At \( T = 3 \): Position = \( (60, -5) \)  
- At \( T = 4 \): Position = \( (80, -5) \)  
- At \( T = 5 \): Position = \( (100, -5) \) (bypassing the obstruction)  
- At \( T = 6 \): Position = \( (120, -5) \)  

### Phase 3: Returning to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)  
- At \( T = 7 \): Move laterally to \( Y = -2.5 \, \text{m} \). Position = \( (140, -2.5) \)  
- At \( T = 8 \): Complete lane change to \( Y = 0 \, \text{m} \). Position = \( (160, 0) \)  

### Final Positions:  
- \( T = 0 \): \( (0, 0) \)  
- \( T = 1 \): \( (20, -2.5) \)  
- \( T = 2 \): \( (40, -5) \)  
- \( T = 3 \): \( (60, -5) \)  
- \( T = 4 \): \( (80, -5) \)  
- \( T = 5 \): \( (100, -5) \)  
- \( T = 6 \): \( (120, -5) \)  
- \( T = 7 \): \( (140, -2.5) \)  
- \( T = 8 \): \( (160, 0) \)  

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above \( 60 \, \text{km/h} \) and safely navigates around the obstruction.
