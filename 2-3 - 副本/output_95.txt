To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed exceeding 60 km/h, we need to calculate the vehicle's position at critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. Here¡¯s the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Key Assumptions**
1. The vehicle starts at (X, Y) = (0, 0) with a velocity of 72 km/h (20 m/s).
2. The adjacent lane is at Y = -5.
3. The obstruction is at (100, 0).
4. The vehicle must maintain a speed above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s) throughout.
5. The lane change takes approximately 2 seconds to complete.
6. After bypassing the obstruction, the vehicle returns to the original lane.

### **Route Plan**
1. **Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):**
   - Start at T = 0, (X, Y) = (0, 0).
   - Transition to Y = -5 over 2 seconds (T = 0 to T = 2).
   - During this time, the vehicle moves forward at 20 m/s.

2. **Bypass the Obstruction:**
   - Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until X > 100.
   - Continue moving forward at 20 m/s.

3. **Return to Original Lane (Y = 0):**
   - Transition back to Y = 0 over 2 seconds after bypassing the obstruction.

### **Position Estimates**
Let¡¯s calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals.

#### **Lane Change Phase (T = 0 to T = 2):**
- **T = 0:** (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **T = 1:** (X, Y) = (20, -2.5) [Halfway through lane change]
- **T = 2:** (X, Y) = (40, -5) [Lane change complete]

#### **Bypass Phase (T = 2 to T = 6):**
- **T = 3:** (X, Y) = (60, -5)
- **T = 4:** (X, Y) = (80, -5)
- **T = 5:** (X, Y) = (100, -5) [Reaches obstruction]
- **T = 6:** (X, Y) = (120, -5) [Obstruction bypassed]

#### **Return to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8):**
- **T = 7:** (X, Y) = (140, -2.5) [Halfway back to original lane]
- **T = 8:** (X, Y) = (160, 0) [Return to original lane complete]

#### **Continue in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10):**
- **T = 9:** (X, Y) = (180, 0)
- **T = 10:** (X, Y) = (200, 0)

### **Summary of Positions**
| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |
| 2        | 40    | -5    |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |
| 8        | 160   | 0     |
| 9        | 180   | 0     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### **Verification of Speed**
- The vehicle travels 20 meters every second, maintaining a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h), which exceeds the minimum speed requirement of 60 km/h.

This plan ensures the vehicle safely bypasses the obstruction while maintaining the required speed.
