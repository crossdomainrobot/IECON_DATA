To navigate around the obstruction while maintaining a speed exceeding 60 km/h, we need to plan the lane transition carefully. Here¡¯s a step-by-step route planning with estimated positions at critical intervals:

---

### **Given:**
- **Initial position:** \( (X, Y) = (0, 0) \)
- **Obstruction position:** \( (100, 0) \)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate:** \( Y = -5 \)
- **Initial velocity:** \( 72 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \)
- **Minimum speed:** \( 60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \)
- **Time frame:** \( T = 0 \) to \( T = 10 \) seconds

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \) throughout.
2. Lane transitions (changing Y-coordinate) occur linearly over time.
3. The vehicle starts transitioning to the adjacent lane at \( T = 1 \) second and completes the transition by \( T = 3 \) seconds.
4. The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane until \( X = 100 \) (obstruction bypassed).
5. The vehicle transitions back to the original lane starting at \( T = 6 \) seconds and completes the transition by \( T = 8 \) seconds.

---

### **Route Planning:**

#### **1. Lane Transition to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds):**
- \( T = 0 \): \( (X, Y) = (0, 0) \)
- \( T = 1 \): \( (X, Y) = (20, -1.67) \) (start transitioning)
- \( T = 2 \): \( (X, Y) = (40, -3.33) \) (mid-transition)
- \( T = 3 \): \( (X, Y) = (60, -5) \) (fully in adjacent lane)

#### **2. Bypassing Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 6 seconds):**
- \( T = 4 \): \( (X, Y) = (80, -5) \) (approaching obstruction)
- \( T = 5 \): \( (X, Y) = (100, -5) \) (bypassing obstruction)
- \( T = 6 \): \( (X, Y) = (120, -5) \) (fully bypassed)

#### **3. Lane Transition Back to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds):**
- \( T = 7 \): \( (X, Y) = (140, -3.33) \) (start transitioning back)
- \( T = 8 \): \( (X, Y) = (160, -1.67) \) (mid-transition)
- \( T = 9 \): \( (X, Y) = (180, 0) \) (fully back in original lane)

#### **4. Continuing in Original Lane (T = 9 to T = 10 seconds):**
- \( T = 10 \): \( (X, Y) = (200, 0) \) (continuing straight)

### **Summary of Positions:**
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y)       |
|----------|-----------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)               |
| 1        | (20, -1.67)          |
| 2        | (40, -3.33)          |
| 3        | (60, -5)             |
| 4        | (80, -5)             |
| 5        | (100, -5)            |
| 6        | (120, -5)            |
| 7        | (140, -3.33)         |
| 8        | (160, -1.67)         |
| 9        | (180, 0)             |
| 10       | (200, 0)             |

### **Explanation:**
- The vehicle transitions smoothly between lanes while maintaining a constant speed of \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).
- The obstruction is bypassed safely by staying in the adjacent lane until \( X = 100 \).
- The vehicle returns to the original lane after bypassing the obstruction.

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed exceeding \( 60 \, \text{km/h} \) and navigates the obstruction safely.
