To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):**  
   Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while maintaining speed.  
2. **Bypass the Obstruction (X = 100):**  
   Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until the obstruction is safely passed.  
3. **Return to the Original Lane (Y = 0):**  
   Transition back to the outer lane (Y = 0) after bypassing the obstruction.

### Assumptions:
- Initial speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s).  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).  
- Obstruction at X = 100 meters.  
- Lane change duration: 2 seconds (smooth transition).  

### Calculations:
1. **Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2):**  
   - At T = 0: (X, Y) = (0, 0).  
   - At T = 1: (X, Y) = (20, -2.5).  
   - At T = 2: (X, Y) = (40, -5).  

2. **Bypass Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6):**  
   - At T = 3: (X, Y) = (60, -5).  
   - At T = 4: (X, Y) = (80, -5).  
   - At T = 5: (X, Y) = (100, -5).  
   - At T = 6: (X, Y) = (120, -5).  

3. **Return to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8):**  
   - At T = 7: (X, Y) = (140, -2.5).  
   - At T = 8: (X, Y) = (160, 0).  

4. **Continue in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10):**  
   - At T = 9: (X, Y) = (180, 0).  
   - At T = 10: (X, Y) = (200, 0).  

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| 0        | (0, 0)          |  
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |  
| 2        | (40, -5)        |  
| 3        | (60, -5)        |  
| 4        | (80, -5)        |  
| 5        | (100, -5)       |  
| 6        | (120, -5)       |  
| 7        | (140, -2.5)     |  
| 8        | (160, 0)        |  
| 9        | (180, 0)        |  
| 10       | (200, 0)        |  

### Explanation:
- The lane change is completed by T = 2, ensuring the vehicle is in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) before reaching the obstruction.  
- The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane until T = 6, bypassing the obstruction at X = 100.  
- The return to the original lane is completed by T = 8.  
- Speed is maintained above 60 km/h throughout the maneuver.  

This plan ensures a smooth and safe transition around the obstruction.
