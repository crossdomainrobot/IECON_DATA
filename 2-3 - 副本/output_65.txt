To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):**  
   Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) smoothly.  
2. **Bypass the Obstruction (X = 100):**  
   Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstruction.  
3. **Return to the Original Lane (Y = 0):**  
   Transition back to the outer lane (Y = 0) after bypassing the obstruction.

### Assumptions:
- **Initial Velocity:** 72 km/h = 20 m/s.  
- **Minimum Speed:** 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.  
- **Lane Change Duration:** Assume 2 seconds for each lane change (to and from the adjacent lane).  
- **Obstruction Position:** (X = 100, Y = 0).  
- **Time Intervals:** 1-second increments.

### Route Plan:

#### Phase 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)  
- **Time:** T = 0 to T = 2 seconds.  
- **Lateral Movement:** Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 linearly over 2 seconds.  
- **Longitudinal Movement:** Continue at 20 m/s.  

#### Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction (Y = -5)  
- **Time:** T = 2 to T = 6 seconds.  
- **Lateral Movement:** Stay at Y = -5.  
- **Longitudinal Movement:** Continue at 20 m/s.  

#### Phase 3: Return to Original Lane (Y = 0)  
- **Time:** T = 6 to T = 8 seconds.  
- **Lateral Movement:** Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 linearly over 2 seconds.  
- **Longitudinal Movement:** Continue at 20 m/s.  

### Position Estimates:

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) | Description                     |
|----------|-------|-------|---------------------------------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     | Starting point.                 |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  | Midway through lane change.     |
| 2        | 40    | -5    | Fully in adjacent lane.         |
| 3        | 60    | -5    | Bypassing obstruction.          |
| 4        | 80    | -5    | Bypassing obstruction.          |
| 5        | 100   | -5    | Passing the obstruction.        |
| 6        | 120   | -5    | Preparing to return to lane.    |
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  | Midway through lane return.     |
| 8        | 160   | 0     | Fully back in original lane.    |
| 9        | 180   | 0     | Continuing in original lane.    |
| 10       | 200   | 0     | Continuing in original lane.    |

### Key Points:
- The lane changes are completed by T = 2 and T = 8 seconds.  
- The obstruction is bypassed at T = 5 seconds.  
- Speed remains constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h), satisfying the minimum speed requirement.  

This plan ensures a smooth and safe maneuver around the obstruction.
