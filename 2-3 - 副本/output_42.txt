To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):**  
   Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
2. **Bypass the Obstruction:**  
   Continue traveling in the adjacent lane until the obstruction is cleared.  
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0):**  
   Transition back to the outer lane after bypassing the obstruction.

### Assumptions:
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h (20 m/s).  
- Speed must exceed 60 km/h (16.67 m/s) throughout.  
- Obstruction is at (100, 0).  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).  
- Lane changes take 2 seconds each.  
- Constant speed of 20 m/s during lane changes and bypassing.

### Route Plan:

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (Y = 0 ¡ú Y = -5)**  
- **Time:** T = 0 to T = 2 seconds.  
- **Lateral Movement:** Linear transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.  
- **Longitudinal Movement:** Constant speed of 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |  
| 2        | 40    | -5    |  

---

#### **Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction**  
- **Time:** T = 2 to T = 6 seconds.  
- **Lateral Movement:** Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
- **Longitudinal Movement:** Constant speed of 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    |  

---

#### **Phase 3: Lane Change Back to Original Lane (Y = -5 ¡ú Y = 0)**  
- **Time:** T = 6 to T = 8 seconds.  
- **Lateral Movement:** Linear transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.  
- **Longitudinal Movement:** Constant speed of 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |  
| 8        | 160   | 0     |  

---

#### **Phase 4: Continue in Original Lane**  
- **Time:** T = 8 to T = 10 seconds.  
- **Lateral Movement:** Stay in the original lane (Y = 0).  
- **Longitudinal Movement:** Constant speed of 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 9        | 180   | 0     |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |  
| 2        | 40    | -5    |  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    |  
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |  
| 8        | 160   | 0     |  
| 9        | 180   | 0     |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |  

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h, successfully bypasses the obstruction, and returns to the original lane.
