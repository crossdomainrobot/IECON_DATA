To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Returning to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**  

### Assumptions:
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s  
- Obstruction is at (100, 0).  
- Adjacent lane is at Y = -5.  
- Time step: 1 second.  

### Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)
- **T = 0**: Start at (0, 0).  
- **T = 1**: Move to (20, -2.5).  
- **T = 2**: Reach (40, -5).  

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6 seconds)
- **T = 3**: Move to (60, -5).  
- **T = 4**: Move to (80, -5).  
- **T = 5**: Move to (100, -5).  
- **T = 6**: Move to (120, -5).  

### Phase 3: Returning to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)
- **T = 7**: Move to (140, -2.5).  
- **T = 8**: Reach (160, 0).  

### Final Positions:
- **T = 0**: (0, 0)  
- **T = 1**: (20, -2.5)  
- **T = 2**: (40, -5)  
- **T = 3**: (60, -5)  
- **T = 4**: (80, -5)  
- **T = 5**: (100, -5)  
- **T = 6**: (120, -5)  
- **T = 7**: (140, -2.5)  
- **T = 8**: (160, 0)  

### Explanation:
1. **Lane Change**: Smoothly transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.  
2. **Bypassing**: Maintain Y = -5 while moving past the obstruction at X = 100.  
3. **Returning**: Smoothly transition back to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.  

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h and safely navigates around the obstruction.
