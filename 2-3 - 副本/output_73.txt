To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we need to calculate the vehicle's position at critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. Here's how we can approach this:

### Assumptions and Initial Conditions:
1. **Initial Position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
2. **Obstruction Position**: (X, Y) = (100, 0)
3. **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5
4. **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h (which is 20 m/s)
5. **Minimum Speed**: Must exceed 60 km/h (which is 16.67 m/s)
6. **Time Interval**: We¡¯ll calculate positions at T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 seconds.

### Lane Transition Plan:
1. **From T = 0 to T = 3 seconds**: Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
2. **From T = 3 to T = 7 seconds**: Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while bypassing the obstruction.
3. **From T = 7 to T = 10 seconds**: Transition back to the outer lane (Y = 0).

### Calculations:
- **Distance traveled along X-axis per second**: 20 meters (since speed is 20 m/s).
- **Lateral movement (Y-axis)**: We¡¯ll assume a smooth transition over 3 seconds for each lane change.

#### Step-by-Step Position Estimates:
1. **T = 0 seconds**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
2. **T = 1 second**: 
   - X = 20 meters
   - Y = -1.67 meters (transitioning to the adjacent lane)
   - Position: (20, -1.67)
3. **T = 2 seconds**: 
   - X = 40 meters
   - Y = -3.33 meters
   - Position: (40, -3.33)
4. **T = 3 seconds**: 
   - X = 60 meters
   - Y = -5 meters (fully in the adjacent lane)
   - Position: (60, -5)
5. **T = 4 seconds**: 
   - X = 80 meters
   - Y = -5 meters
   - Position: (80, -5)
6. **T = 5 seconds**: 
   - X = 100 meters
   - Y = -5 meters (bypassing the obstruction)
   - Position: (100, -5)
7. **T = 6 seconds**: 
   - X = 120 meters
   - Y = -5 meters
   - Position: (120, -5)
8. **T = 7 seconds**: 
   - X = 140 meters
   - Y = -3.33 meters (transitioning back to the outer lane)
   - Position: (140, -3.33)
9. **T = 8 seconds**: 
   - X = 160 meters
   - Y = -1.67 meters
   - Position: (160, -1.67)
10. **T = 9 seconds**: 
    - X = 180 meters
    - Y = 0 meters (fully back in the outer lane)
    - Position: (180, 0)
11. **T = 10 seconds**: 
    - X = 200 meters
    - Y = 0 meters
    - Position: (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions:
- T = 0: (0, 0)
- T = 1: (20, -1.67)
- T = 2: (40, -3.33)
- T = 3: (60, -5)
- T = 4: (80, -5)
- T = 5: (100, -5)
- T = 6: (120, -5)
- T = 7: (140, -3.33)
- T = 8: (160, -1.67)
- T = 9: (180, 0)
- T = 10: (200, 0)

This plan ensures that the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h while safely navigating around the obstruction and returning to the original lane.
