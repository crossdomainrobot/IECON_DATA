To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):**  
   Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
2. **Bypass the Obstruction (X = 100):**  
   Stay in the adjacent lane while passing the obstruction.  
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0):**  
   Transition back to the outer lane after bypassing the obstruction.

### Assumptions:
- Vehicle speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s).  
- Lane change duration: 2 seconds (smooth transition).  
- Obstruction is at X = 100 meters.  
- Time intervals: 1 second.  

### Route Plan:

#### Phase 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)  
- **T = 0 to T = 2 seconds:**  
  - X increases linearly: \( X = 20 \cdot T \).  
  - Y transitions from 0 to -5: \( Y = -2.5 \cdot T \).  

#### Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction (Y = -5)  
- **T = 2 to T = 5 seconds:**  
  - X continues to increase linearly: \( X = 20 \cdot T \).  
  - Y remains constant at -5.  

#### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to Original Lane (Y = 0)  
- **T = 5 to T = 7 seconds:**  
  - X continues to increase linearly: \( X = 20 \cdot T \).  
  - Y transitions from -5 to 0: \( Y = -5 + 2.5 \cdot (T - 5) \).  

#### Phase 4: Continue in Original Lane (Y = 0)  
- **T = 7 to T = 10 seconds:**  
  - X continues to increase linearly: \( X = 20 \cdot T \).  
  - Y remains constant at 0.  

### Position Estimates:

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m)       | Description                          |
|----------|-------|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| 0        | 0     | 0           | Start in outer lane.                 |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5        | Transitioning to adjacent lane.      |
| 2        | 40    | -5          | Fully in adjacent lane.              |
| 3        | 60    | -5          | Bypassing obstruction.               |
| 4        | 80    | -5          | Bypassing obstruction.               |
| 5        | 100   | -5          | Obstruction cleared.                 |
| 6        | 120   | -2.5        | Transitioning back to outer lane.    |
| 7        | 140   | 0           | Fully back in outer lane.            |
| 8        | 160   | 0           | Continuing in outer lane.            |
| 9        | 180   | 0           | Continuing in outer lane.            |
| 10       | 200   | 0           | Continuing in outer lane.            |

### Key Points:
- The vehicle maintains a speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) throughout.  
- The lane changes are completed smoothly within 2 seconds each.  
- The obstruction is bypassed safely while staying in the adjacent lane.  
- The vehicle returns to the original lane after clearing the obstruction.  

This plan ensures the vehicle navigates the obstruction efficiently while adhering to the speed constraint.
