To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Returning to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**  

### Assumptions:
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s  
- Obstruction is at (100, 0).  
- Adjacent lane is at Y = -5.  
- Time step: 1 second.  

### Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)
- **T = 0**: Start at (0, 0).  
- **T = 1**: Move to (20, -2.5).  
- **T = 2**: Move to (40, -5).  

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6 seconds)
- **T = 3**: Move to (60, -5).  
- **T = 4**: Move to (80, -5).  
- **T = 5**: Move to (100, -5).  
- **T = 6**: Move to (120, -5).  

### Phase 3: Returning to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)
- **T = 7**: Move to (140, -2.5).  
- **T = 8**: Move to (160, 0).  

### Final Positions:
- **T = 9**: Move to (180, 0).  
- **T = 10**: Move to (200, 0).  

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| 0        | (0, 0)          |  
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |  
| 2        | (40, -5)        |  
| 3        | (60, -5)        |  
| 4        | (80, -5)        |  
| 5        | (100, -5)       |  
| 6        | (120, -5)       |  
| 7        | (140, -2.5)     |  
| 8        | (160, 0)        |  
| 9        | (180, 0)        |  
| 10       | (200, 0)        |  

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
