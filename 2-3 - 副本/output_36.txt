To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we'll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypass the obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Return to the original lane (Y = 0)**  

### Assumptions:
- Starting position: (0, 0)  
- Obstruction: (100, 0)  
- Adjacent lane: Y = -5  
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h (20 m/s)  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)  
- Time step: 1 second  

### Phase 1: Transition to the Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 3)
- **Lateral movement**: Shift from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds.  
- **Lateral speed**: ¦¤Y = -5 / 3 ¡Ö -1.67 m/s (smooth lateral transition).  
- **Longitudinal movement**: Maintain speed of 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m)         | Y (m)         |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| 0        | 0             | 0             |
| 1        | 20            | -1.67         |
| 2        | 40            | -3.33         |
| 3        | 60            | -5            |

### Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7)
- **Lateral movement**: Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
- **Longitudinal movement**: Continue at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m)         | Y (m)         |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| 4        | 80            | -5            |
| 5        | 100           | -5            |
| 6        | 120           | -5            |
| 7        | 140           | -5            |

### Phase 3: Return to the Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10)
- **Lateral movement**: Shift from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.  
- **Lateral speed**: ¦¤Y = 5 / 3 ¡Ö 1.67 m/s (smooth lateral transition).  
- **Longitudinal movement**: Maintain speed of 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m)         | Y (m)         |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| 8        | 160           | -3.33         |
| 9        | 180           | -1.67         |
| 10       | 200           | 0             |

### Summary:
- **Total distance traveled**: 200 m in 10 seconds (average speed = 20 m/s = 72 km/h, satisfying the speed constraint).  
- **Obstruction bypassed**: At T = 5, the vehicle is at (100, -5), safely in the adjacent lane.  
- **Lane transitions**: Smooth lateral movements ensure stability and safety.  

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h while safely navigating around the obstruction.
