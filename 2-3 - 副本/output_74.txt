To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases: transitioning to the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals, ensuring the speed remains above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).

### **Assumptions**
1. **Initial Position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
2. **Obstruction Position**: (X, Y) = (100, 0)
3. **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5
4. **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s
5. **Minimum Speed Constraint**: >16.67 m/s
6. **Lane Change Duration**: Assume 3 seconds for each lane change.

### **Route Plan**
#### **Phase 1: Transition to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 3)**
- **Lateral Movement**: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds.
- **Lateral Velocity**: (-5 m) / (3 s) = -1.67 m/s
- **Longitudinal Velocity**: Maintain 20 m/s (constant speed).

#### **Phase 2: Bypass Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7)**
- **Lateral Position**: Stay at Y = -5.
- **Longitudinal Velocity**: Maintain 20 m/s.

#### **Phase 3: Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10)**
- **Lateral Movement**: Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.
- **Lateral Velocity**: 5 m / 3 s = 1.67 m/s
- **Longitudinal Velocity**: Maintain 20 m/s.

### **Position Estimates**
We calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals using the formulas:
- **X(t)**: X(t) = 20 * t
- **Y(t)**:
  - **Phase 1 (T = 0 to T = 3)**: Y(t) = -1.67 * t
  - **Phase 2 (T = 3 to T = 7)**: Y(t) = -5
  - **Phase 3 (T = 7 to T = 10)**: Y(t) = -5 + 1.67 * (t - 7)

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -1.67 |
| 2        | 40    | -3.33 |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -5    |
| 8        | 160   | -3.33 |
| 9        | 180   | -1.67 |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### **Summary**
- The vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane by T = 3.
- It bypasses the obstruction at T = 5 (X = 100, Y = -5).
- It returns to the original lane by T = 10.
- The speed remains constant at 20 m/s (>16.67 m/s) throughout the maneuver.
