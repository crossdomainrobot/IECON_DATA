To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the vehicle's movement into critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. The vehicle starts at (0, 0) with an initial velocity of 72 km/h (20 m/s) and must maintain a speed exceeding 60 km/h (16.67 m/s). The adjacent lane is at Y = -5, and the obstruction is at (100, 0).

### Assumptions:
1. **Lane Change Duration**: We assume the lane change takes 2 seconds (a smooth transition).
2. **Bypass Duration**: The vehicle will stay in the adjacent lane until it has fully bypassed the obstruction at X = 100.
3. **Return to Original Lane**: After bypassing the obstruction, the vehicle will return to the original lane (Y = 0) in another 2 seconds.

### Step-by-Step Plan:

#### 1. **Initial Movement (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)**:
   - The vehicle continues in the outer lane (Y = 0) at 20 m/s.
   - At T = 1 second: \( X = 20 \times 1 = 20 \), \( Y = 0 \) ¡ú (20, 0)
   - At T = 2 seconds: \( X = 20 \times 2 = 40 \), \( Y = 0 \) ¡ú (40, 0)

#### 2. **Lane Change (T = 2 to T = 4 seconds)**:
   - The vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) over 2 seconds.
   - At T = 3 seconds: \( X = 20 \times 3 = 60 \), \( Y = -2.5 \) (midway transition) ¡ú (60, -2.5)
   - At T = 4 seconds: \( X = 20 \times 4 = 80 \), \( Y = -5 \) ¡ú (80, -5)

#### 3. **Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 4 to T = 6 seconds)**:
   - The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while bypassing the obstruction.
   - At T = 5 seconds: \( X = 20 \times 5 = 100 \), \( Y = -5 \) ¡ú (100, -5)
   - At T = 6 seconds: \( X = 20 \times 6 = 120 \), \( Y = -5 \) ¡ú (120, -5)

#### 4. **Return to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)**:
   - The vehicle transitions back to the original lane (Y = 0) over 2 seconds.
   - At T = 7 seconds: \( X = 20 \times 7 = 140 \), \( Y = -2.5 \) (midway transition) ¡ú (140, -2.5)
   - At T = 8 seconds: \( X = 20 \times 8 = 160 \), \( Y = 0 \) ¡ú (160, 0)

#### 5. **Continue in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds)**:
   - The vehicle continues in the original lane (Y = 0) at 20 m/s.
   - At T = 9 seconds: \( X = 20 \times 9 = 180 \), \( Y = 0 \) ¡ú (180, 0)
   - At T = 10 seconds: \( X = 20 \times 10 = 200 \), \( Y = 0 \) ¡ú (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions:
- T = 1 second: (20, 0)
- T = 2 seconds: (40, 0)
- T = 3 seconds: (60, -2.5)
- T = 4 seconds: (80, -5)
- T = 5 seconds: (100, -5)
- T = 6 seconds: (120, -5)
- T = 7 seconds: (140, -2.5)
- T = 8 seconds: (160, 0)
- T = 9 seconds: (180, 0)
- T = 10 seconds: (200, 0)

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed exceeding 60 km/h and smoothly transitions between lanes.
