To plan the vehicle¡¯s route around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into phases: **lane transition**, **bypassing the obstruction**, and **returning to the original lane**. The vehicle¡¯s speed is 72 km/h (20 m/s), and the obstruction is at (100, 0). The adjacent lane is at \( Y = -5 \).

### Assumptions:
1. The lane change takes 2 seconds (linear lateral movement).
2. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s.
3. The obstruction is bypassed from \( X = 100 \) to \( X = 120 \) (20 meters beyond the obstruction).
4. The return to the original lane takes another 2 seconds.

### Critical Intervals:
- **T = 0 to T = 2**: Lane transition from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \).
- **T = 2 to T = 6**: Bypass the obstruction while staying in the adjacent lane (\( Y = -5 \)).
- **T = 6 to T = 8**: Return to the original lane (\( Y = 0 \)).

### Position Estimates:
1. **T = 0**: Start at \( (0, 0) \).
2. **T = 1**: Move forward 20 meters and halfway through the lane change: \( (20, -2.5) \).
3. **T = 2**: Complete lane change: \( (40, -5) \).
4. **T = 3**: Continue forward: \( (60, -5) \).
5. **T = 4**: Continue forward: \( (80, -5) \).
6. **T = 5**: Reach the obstruction point: \( (100, -5) \).
7. **T = 6**: Bypass the obstruction: \( (120, -5) \).
8. **T = 7**: Begin returning to the original lane: \( (140, -2.5) \).
9. **T = 8**: Complete return to the original lane: \( (160, 0) \).
10. **T = 9**: Continue forward: \( (180, 0) \).
11. **T = 10**: Continue forward: \( (200, 0) \).

### Summary of Positions:
- \( T = 0 \): \( (0, 0) \)
- \( T = 1 \): \( (20, -2.5) \)
- \( T = 2 \): \( (40, -5) \)
- \( T = 3 \): \( (60, -5) \)
- \( T = 4 \): \( (80, -5) \)
- \( T = 5 \): \( (100, -5) \)
- \( T = 6 \): \( (120, -5) \)
- \( T = 7 \): \( (140, -2.5) \)
- \( T = 8 \): \( (160, 0) \)
- \( T = 9 \): \( (180, 0) \)
- \( T = 10 \): \( (200, 0) \)

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction safely while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
