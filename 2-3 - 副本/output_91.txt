To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Returning to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**  

### Assumptions:
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h (20 m/s)  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane)  
- Obstruction is at (100, 0)  
- Time step: 1 second  

### Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)
- **Objective**: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5.  
- **Lane change duration**: 2 seconds (smooth transition).  
- **Lateral speed**: 2.5 m/s (5 meters / 2 seconds).  
- **Longitudinal speed**: Maintain 20 m/s.  

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |
| 2        | 40    | -5    |

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6 seconds)
- **Objective**: Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstruction at X = 100.  
- **Longitudinal speed**: Maintain 20 m/s.  

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |

### Phase 3: Returning to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)
- **Objective**: Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0.  
- **Lane change duration**: 2 seconds (smooth transition).  
- **Lateral speed**: 2.5 m/s (5 meters / 2 seconds).  
- **Longitudinal speed**: Maintain 20 m/s.  

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |
| 8        | 160   | 0     |

### Final Phase: Continuing in the Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds)
- **Objective**: Continue traveling in the original lane (Y = 0).  
- **Longitudinal speed**: Maintain 20 m/s.  

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 9        | 180   | 0     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |
| 2        | 40    | -5    |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |
| 8        | 160   | 0     |
| 9        | 180   | 0     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h, successfully bypasses the obstruction, and returns to the original lane within 10 seconds.
