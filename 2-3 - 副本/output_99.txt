To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**  

### Assumptions:
- Initial velocity: \( 72 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- Minimum speed: \( 60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- Lane width: \( 5 \, \text{m} \) (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane)  
- Obstruction at \( X = 100 \, \text{m} \)  
- Time step: \( 1 \, \text{second} \)  

### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)
- Duration: \( 2 \, \text{seconds} \)  
- Lateral movement: \( Y \) transitions from \( 0 \) to \( -5 \) linearly over \( 2 \, \text{seconds} \).  
- Longitudinal movement: \( X \) increases at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).  

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)
- Duration: \( 3 \, \text{seconds} \)  
- Lateral position: \( Y = -5 \) (stay in the adjacent lane).  
- Longitudinal movement: \( X \) increases at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).  

### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)
- Duration: \( 2 \, \text{seconds} \)  
- Lateral movement: \( Y \) transitions from \( -5 \) to \( 0 \) linearly over \( 2 \, \text{seconds} \).  
- Longitudinal movement: \( X \) increases at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).  

### Route Plan:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) | Description                     |
|----------|-------|-------|---------------------------------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     | Start in the outer lane.        |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  | Begin lane change.              |
| 2        | 40    | -5    | Complete lane change.           |
| 3        | 60    | -5    | Bypassing obstruction.          |
| 4        | 80    | -5    | Bypassing obstruction.          |
| 5        | 100   | -5    | Pass the obstruction.           |
| 6        | 120   | -2.5  | Begin lane change back.         |
| 7        | 140   | 0     | Complete lane change back.      |
| 8        | 160   | 0     | Continue in the original lane.  |
| 9        | 180   | 0     | Continue in the original lane.  |
| 10       | 200   | 0     | Continue in the original lane.  |

### Explanation:
1. **Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2):**  
   - \( Y \) transitions linearly from \( 0 \) to \( -5 \) over \( 2 \, \text{seconds} \).  
   - \( X \) increases by \( 20 \, \text{m} \) each second.  

2. **Bypassing Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 5):**  
   - \( Y \) remains at \( -5 \).  
   - \( X \) increases by \( 20 \, \text{m} \) each second.  

3. **Lane Change Back (T = 5 to T = 7):**  
   - \( Y \) transitions linearly from \( -5 \) to \( 0 \) over \( 2 \, \text{seconds} \).  
   - \( X \) increases by \( 20 \, \text{m} \) each second.  

4. **Continuing in Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10):**  
   - \( Y \) remains at \( 0 \).  
   - \( X \) increases by \( 20 \, \text{m} \) each second.  

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above \( 60 \, \text{km/h} \) and safely navigates around the obstruction.
