To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into phases:  
1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Returning to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**  

### Assumptions:  
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane)  
- Obstruction at X = 100 meters  

### Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)  
- **Time Interval:** 0 to 2 seconds  
- **Action:** Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5  
- **X-Position:** Moves forward at 20 m/s  
- **Y-Position:** Linearly changes from 0 to -5  

**Positions:**  
- T = 0: (0, 0)  
- T = 1: (20, -2.5)  
- T = 2: (40, -5)  

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6 seconds)  
- **Time Interval:** 2 to 6 seconds  
- **Action:** Continue in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until X > 100  
- **X-Position:** Moves forward at 20 m/s  

**Positions:**  
- T = 3: (60, -5)  
- T = 4: (80, -5)  
- T = 5: (100, -5)  
- T = 6: (120, -5)  

### Phase 3: Returning to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)  
- **Time Interval:** 6 to 8 seconds  
- **Action:** Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0  
- **X-Position:** Moves forward at 20 m/s  
- **Y-Position:** Linearly changes from -5 to 0  

**Positions:**  
- T = 7: (140, -2.5)  
- T = 8: (160, 0)  

### Final Phase: Continuing in the Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds)  
- **Time Interval:** 8 to 10 seconds  
- **Action:** Continue in the original lane (Y = 0)  
- **X-Position:** Moves forward at 20 m/s  

**Positions:**  
- T = 9: (180, 0)  
- T = 10: (200, 0)  

### Summary of Positions:  
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |  
| 2        | 40    | -5    |  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    |  
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |  
| 8        | 160   | 0     |  
| 9        | 180   | 0     |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |  

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
