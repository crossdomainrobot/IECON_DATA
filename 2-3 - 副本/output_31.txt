To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break down the movement into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):**  
   - Transition from the current lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
   - Assume this takes **2 seconds** for a smooth lane change.

2. **Bypassing the Obstruction:**  
   - Travel in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until the obstruction at X = 100 is bypassed.  
   - The vehicle must maintain a speed exceeding 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).

3. **Return to the Original Lane (Y = 0):**  
   - Transition back to the original lane (Y = 0).  
   - Assume this also takes **2 seconds**.

### Step-by-Step Position Estimation

#### Vehicle Speed:
- Initial speed: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.  
- Maintain speed > 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.  
- Assume constant speed of 20 m/s for simplicity.

#### Obstruction:
- Located at X = 100 meters.  
- Bypass the obstruction in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).

#### Critical Intervals:
1. **T = 0 to T = 2: Lane Change to Y = -5**  
   - X increases linearly: X = 20 * T.  
   - Y transitions from 0 to -5: Y = -2.5 * T.  

2. **T = 2 to T = 6: Travel in Adjacent Lane**  
   - X increases linearly: X = 20 * T.  
   - Y remains constant at Y = -5.  

3. **T = 6 to T = 8: Return to Y = 0**  
   - X increases linearly: X = 20 * T.  
   - Y transitions from -5 to 0: Y = -5 + 2.5 * (T - 6).

|----------|------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| T = 0    | 0          | 0        | Starting position.                            |
| T = 1    | 20         | -2.5     | Lane change in progress.                      |
| T = 2    | 40         | -5       | Fully in adjacent lane.                       |
| T = 3    | 60         | -5       | Traveling in adjacent lane.                   |
| T = 4    | 80         | -5       | Traveling in adjacent lane.                   |
| T = 5    | 100        | -5       | Bypassing the obstruction.                    |
| T = 6    | 120        | -5       | Traveling in adjacent lane.                   |
| T = 7    | 140        | -2.5     | Returning to original lane.                   |
| T = 8    | 160        | 0        | Fully back in original lane.                  |
| T = 9    | 180        | 0        | Continuing in original lane.                  |
| T = 10   | 200        | 0        | Continuing in original lane.                  |

### Summary:
- **Lane Change:** Completed by T = 2.  
- **Bypassing Obstruction:** Completed by T = 5.  
- **Return to Original Lane:** Completed by T = 8.  
- **Final Position at T = 10:** (200, 0).  

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (> 60 km/h) and safely navigates around the obstruction.
