To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypass the obstruction at X = 100**  
3. **Return to the original lane (Y = 0)**

### Assumptions:
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h (20 m/s)  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane)  
- Obstacle location: (100, 0)  
- Time starts at T = 0  

### Phase 1: Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5)
We¡¯ll assume the lane change takes **2 seconds** and is completed by T = 2. During this phase, the vehicle moves laterally while maintaining a speed of at least 60 km/h.

### Phase 2: Bypass the obstruction (X = 100)
The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstruction. We¡¯ll assume this phase lasts until T = 6.

### Phase 3: Return to the original lane (Y = 0)
The vehicle transitions back to the original lane over **2 seconds**, completing the maneuver by T = 8.

### Position Estimates:
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at 1-second intervals. Since the vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s along the X-axis, the X-coordinate increases by 20 meters every second.

#### T = 0:  
- Position: (0, 0)  
- Action: Start lane change.

#### T = 1:  
- X = 20 (20 m/s ¡Á 1 s)  
- Y = -2.5 (halfway through lane change)  
- Position: (20, -2.5)

#### T = 2:  
- X = 40  
- Y = -5 (lane change complete)  
- Position: (40, -5)

#### T = 3:  
- X = 60  
- Y = -5  
- Position: (60, -5)

#### T = 4:  
- X = 80  
- Y = -5  
- Position: (80, -5)

#### T = 5:  
- X = 100  
- Y = -5  
- Position: (100, -5)  
- Action: Start return to original lane.

#### T = 6:  
- X = 120  
- Y = -2.5 (halfway through return)  
- Position: (120, -2.5)

#### T = 7:  
- X = 140  
- Y = 0 (return complete)  
- Position: (140, 0)

#### T = 8:  
- X = 160  
- Y = 0  
- Position: (160, 0)

### Summary:
The vehicle successfully bypasses the obstruction and returns to the original lane by T = 8. The critical positions are:

| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| 0        | (0, 0)          |  
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |  
| 2        | (40, -5)        |  
| 3        | (60, -5)        |  
| 4        | (80, -5)        |  
| 5        | (100, -5)       |  
| 6        | (120, -2.5)     |  
| 7        | (140, 0)        |  
| 8        | (160, 0)        |  

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h throughout the maneuver.
