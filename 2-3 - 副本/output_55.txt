To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**

### Assumptions:
- **Initial Velocity:** 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum Speed:** 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- **Obstruction Position:** (100, 0)
- **Adjacent Lane Position:** Y = -5
- **Time Interval:** 1 second

### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)
We¡¯ll assume the lane change takes **2 seconds** and is completed by **T = 2**.

- **T = 0:** (0, 0)
- **T = 1:** (20, -2.5)  // Halfway through the lane change
- **T = 2:** (40, -5)    // Fully in the adjacent lane

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)
We¡¯ll maintain the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while bypassing the obstruction. The vehicle continues at 20 m/s.

- **T = 3:** (60, -5)
- **T = 4:** (80, -5)
- **T = 5:** (100, -5)  // Obstruction bypassed

### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)
We¡¯ll assume the lane change back takes **2 seconds** and is completed by **T = 7**.

- **T = 6:** (120, -2.5)  // Halfway through the lane change
- **T = 7:** (140, 0)     // Fully back in the original lane

### Final Phase: Continue in the Original Lane
The vehicle continues in the original lane (Y = 0) at 20 m/s.

- **T = 8:** (160, 0)
- **T = 9:** (180, 0)
- **T = 10:** (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions:
- **T = 0:** (0, 0)
- **T = 1:** (20, -2.5)
- **T = 2:** (40, -5)
- **T = 3:** (60, -5)
- **T = 4:** (80, -5)
- **T = 5:** (100, -5)
- **T = 6:** (120, -2.5)
- **T = 7:** (140, 0)
- **T = 8:** (160, 0)
- **T = 9:** (180, 0)
- **T = 10:** (200, 0)

This plan ensures that the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h throughout the maneuver and successfully navigates around the obstruction.
