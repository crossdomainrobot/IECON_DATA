To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):**  
   Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) smoothly.  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction:**  
   Maintain the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstruction at X = 100.  
3. **Returning to the Original Lane (Y = 0):**  
   Transition back to the outer lane (Y = 0) after bypassing the obstruction.

### Assumptions:
- Vehicle speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s).  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).  
- Obstruction at X = 100 meters.  
- Time step: 1 second.  

### Route Planning:
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at each second (T = 0 to T = 10).

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2)**  
- **T = 0:** Start at (0, 0).  
- **T = 1:** Move to (20, -2.5).  
- **T = 2:** Complete lane change to (40, -5).  

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)**  
- **T = 3:** (60, -5).  
- **T = 4:** (80, -5).  
- **T = 5:** (100, -5).  
- **T = 6:** (120, -5).  

#### **Phase 3: Returning to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)**  
- **T = 7:** (140, -2.5).  
- **T = 8:** (160, 0).  

#### **Phase 4: Continuing in the Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)**  
- **T = 9:** (180, 0).  
- **T = 10:** (200, 0).

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| 0        | (0, 0)          |  
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |  
| 2        | (40, -5)        |  
| 3        | (60, -5)        |  
| 4        | (80, -5)        |  
| 5        | (100, -5)       |  
| 6        | (120, -5)       |  
| 7        | (140, -2.5)     |  
| 8        | (160, 0)        |  
| 9        | (180, 0)        |  
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

### Explanation:
1. **Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2):**  
   - The vehicle moves laterally from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds while maintaining a speed of 20 m/s.  
   - Lateral movement is linear: -2.5 meters per second.  

2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6):**  
   - The vehicle stays in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) and passes the obstruction at X = 100.  

3. **Returning to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8):**  
   - The vehicle transitions back to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.  

4. **Continuing in the Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10):**  
   - The vehicle maintains its position in the outer lane (Y = 0) and continues forward.  

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction safely while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
