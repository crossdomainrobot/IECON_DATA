To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into phases and calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals. Here¡¯s the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Key Assumptions and Parameters**
1. **Initial Position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
2. **Obstruction Position**: (100, 0)
3. **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5
4. **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s
5. **Minimum Speed Constraint**: >60 km/h = 16.67 m/s
6. **Time Interval**: 1 second

### **Phases of the Maneuver**
1. **Approach Phase (T = 0 to T = 4 seconds)**:
   - Continue in the outer lane (Y = 0) until nearing the obstruction.
2. **Lane Change Phase (T = 4 to T = 6 seconds)**:
   - Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while maintaining speed.
3. **Bypass Phase (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)**:
   - Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) to bypass the obstruction.
4. **Return Phase (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds)**:
   - Transition back to the outer lane (Y = 0).

### **Position Estimates**
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at each second, assuming constant speed of 20 m/s.

| **Time (T)** | **Phase**        | **X-coordinate (m)** | **Y-coordinate (m)** | **Position (X, Y)** |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|

| T = 5        | Lane Change      | 100                   | -5                    | (100, -5)           |
| T = 6        | Bypass           | 120                   | -5                    | (120, -5)           |

| T = 10       | Return           | 200                   | 0                     | (200, 0)            |

### **Explanation of Calculations**
1. **Approach Phase (T = 0 to T = 4)**:
   - The vehicle moves at 20 m/s, so X increases by 20 meters each second.
   - Y remains at 0 (outer lane).

2. **Lane Change Phase (T = 4 to T = 6)**:
   - The vehicle transitions from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.
   - Y changes linearly: at T = 4, Y = -2.5; at T = 5, Y = -5.

3. **Bypass Phase (T = 6 to T = 8)**:
   - The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while bypassing the obstruction.

4. **Return Phase (T = 8 to T = 10)**:
   - The vehicle transitions back to the outer lane (Y = 0) over 2 seconds.
   - Y changes linearly: at T = 8, Y = -2.5; at T = 9, Y = 0.

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction smoothly while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
