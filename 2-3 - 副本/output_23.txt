To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the vehicle's movement into critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. We'll assume the vehicle maintains a constant speed of **72 km/h (20 m/s)** throughout the maneuver, ensuring it stays above the minimum speed requirement of **60 km/h (16.67 m/s)**.

### Key Assumptions:
1. **Initial Position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0) at T = 0.
2. **Obstruction Position**: (X, Y) = (100, 0).
3. **Adjacent Lane**: Y = -5.
4. **Vehicle Speed**: 20 m/s (constant).
5. **Lane Change Duration**: Assume it takes **2 seconds** to transition from one lane to the adjacent lane.

### Route Plan:
1. **T = 0 to T = 2**: Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
   - **Lateral Movement**: Y decreases linearly from 0 to -5.
   - **Longitudinal Movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.
   - **Positions**:
     - T = 1: (X, Y) = (20, -2.5).
     - T = 2: (X, Y) = (40, -5).

2. **T = 2 to T = 6**: Travel in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) to bypass the obstruction.
   - **Lateral Movement**: Y remains constant at -5.
   - **Longitudinal Movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.
   - **Positions**:
     - T = 3: (X, Y) = (60, -5).
     - T = 4: (X, Y) = (80, -5).
     - T = 5: (X, Y) = (100, -5).
     - T = 6: (X, Y) = (120, -5).

3. **T = 6 to T = 8**: Transition back to the outer lane (Y = 0).
   - **Lateral Movement**: Y increases linearly from -5 to 0.
   - **Longitudinal Movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.
   - **Positions**:
     - T = 7: (X, Y) = (140, -2.5).
     - T = 8: (X, Y) = (160, 0).

4. **T = 8 to T = 10**: Continue traveling in the outer lane (Y = 0).
   - **Lateral Movement**: Y remains constant at 0.
   - **Longitudinal Movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.
   - **Positions**:
     - T = 9: (X, Y) = (180, 0).
     - T = 10: (X, Y) = (200, 0).

### Summary of Positions at Critical Intervals:
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|-----------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |
| 2        | (40, -5)        |
| 3        | (60, -5)        |
| 4        | (80, -5)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -5)       |
| 7        | (140, -2.5)     |
| 8        | (160, 0)        |
| 9        | (180, 0)        |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

### Notes:
- The vehicle bypasses the obstruction at T = 5, when it reaches X = 100 in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
- The lane changes are smooth and linear, ensuring safety and stability.
- The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
