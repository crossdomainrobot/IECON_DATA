To construct a route plan that allows you to bypass the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):** Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
2. **Bypass the Obstruction at X = 100:** Continue traveling in the adjacent lane until you clear the obstruction.
3. **Return to the Original Lane (Y = 0):** Transition back to the outer lane.

### Assumptions:
- Initial speed: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
- Total time for lane changes: 2 seconds (1 second for each lane change).
- Time to bypass the obstruction: Approximately 5 seconds (100 meters at 20 m/s).
- Total time for the maneuver: 10 seconds.

### Step-by-Step Route Plan:

#### 1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):**
   - Duration: 1 second (T = 0 to T = 1).
   - Lateral movement: From Y = 0 to Y = -5.
   - X-coordinate: Travels 20 meters (20 m/s ¡Á 1 s).
   - Position at T = 1: (20, -5).

#### 2. **Bypass the Obstruction (X = 100):**
   - Duration: 5 seconds (T = 1 to T = 6).
   - Lateral position: Y = -5.
   - X-coordinate: Travels 100 meters (20 m/s ¡Á 5 s).
   - Position at T = 6: (120, -5).

#### 3. **Return to the Original Lane (Y = 0):**
   - Duration: 1 second (T = 6 to T = 7).
   - Lateral movement: From Y = -5 to Y = 0.
   - X-coordinate: Travels 20 meters (20 m/s ¡Á 1 s).
   - Position at T = 7: (140, 0).

#### 4. **Continue Traveling in the Original Lane:**
   - Duration: 3 seconds (T = 7 to T = 10).
   - Lateral position: Y = 0.
   - X-coordinate: Travels 60 meters (20 m/s ¡Á 3 s).
   - Position at T = 10: (200, 0).

### Summary of Positions:
- T = 0: (0, 0)
- T = 1: (20, -5)
- T = 2: (40, -5)
- T = 3: (60, -5)
- T = 4: (80, -5)
- T = 5: (100, -5)
- T = 6: (120, -5)
- T = 7: (140, 0)
- T = 8: (160, 0)
- T = 9: (180, 0)
- T = 10: (200, 0)

This plan ensures you bypass the obstruction while maintaining a speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) and complete the maneuver within 10 seconds.
