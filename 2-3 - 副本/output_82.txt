To construct a route plan, we¡¯ll break down the maneuver into phases: **lane transition**, **bypassing the obstruction**, and **returning to the original lane**. Here¡¯s the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Key Parameters**
1. **Initial Position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)  
2. **Obstruction Position**: (100, 0)  
3. **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5  
4. **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s  
5. **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s  

---

### **Assumptions**
- Lane transition takes **2 seconds** (smooth lateral movement).  
- Bypassing the obstruction requires staying in the adjacent lane until X > 100.  
- Returning to the original lane takes **2 seconds**.  

---

### **Route Plan**
#### **Phase 1: Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2)**
- **Lateral Movement**: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.  
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Continue at 20 m/s.  

**Positions**:  
- T = 1: (20, -2.5)  
- T = 2: (40, -5)  

---

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)**
- **Lateral Position**: Stay at Y = -5.  
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Continue at 20 m/s.  

**Positions**:  
- T = 3: (60, -5)  
- T = 4: (80, -5)  
- T = 5: (100, -5)  
- T = 6: (120, -5)  

---

#### **Phase 3: Returning to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)**
- **Lateral Movement**: Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.  
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Continue at 20 m/s.  

**Positions**:  
- T = 7: (140, -2.5)  
- T = 8: (160, 0)  

---

#### **Phase 4: Continuing in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)**
- **Lateral Position**: Stay at Y = 0.  
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Continue at 20 m/s.  

**Positions**:  
- T = 9: (180, 0)  
- T = 10: (200, 0)

### **Summary of Positions**
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| 0        | (0, 0)          |  
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |  
| 2        | (40, -5)        |  
| 3        | (60, -5)        |  
| 4        | (80, -5)        |  
| 5        | (100, -5)       |  
| 6        | (120, -5)       |  
| 7        | (140, -2.5)     |  
| 8        | (160, 0)        |  
| 9        | (180, 0)        |  
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

### **Verification**
- **Speed Constraint**: Maintained at 20 m/s (72 km/h), exceeding 16.67 m/s (60 km/h).  
- **Obstruction Bypass**: Vehicle stays in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until X > 100.  
- **Smooth Transitions**: Lane changes are completed in 2 seconds each.  

This plan ensures safe and efficient navigation around the obstruction.
