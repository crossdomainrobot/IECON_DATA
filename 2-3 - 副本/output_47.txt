To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane**: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5.  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction**: Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until X > 100.  
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane**: Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0.  

### Assumptions:
- Vehicle speed: 72 km/h = 20 m/s (constant).  
- Lane change duration: 3 seconds (smooth transition).  
- Obstruction is at X = 100 m.  

### Route Plan:
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at 1-second intervals.  

#### Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 3)
- Y changes linearly from 0 to -5 over 3 seconds.  
- X increases at 20 m/s.  

| T (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|-------|-------|-------|  
| 0     | 0     | 0     |  
| 1     | 20    | -1.67 |  
| 2     | 40    | -3.33 |  
| 3     | 60    | -5    |  

#### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7)
- Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
- X increases at 20 m/s.  

| T (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|-------|-------|-------|  
| 4     | 80    | -5    |  
| 5     | 100   | -5    |  
| 6     | 120   | -5    |  
| 7     | 140   | -5    |  

#### Phase 3: Lane Change Back (T = 7 to T = 10)
- Y changes linearly from -5 to 0 over 3 seconds.  
- X increases at 20 m/s.  

| T (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|-------|-------|-------|  
| 8     | 160   | -3.33 |  
| 9     | 180   | -1.67 |  
| 10    | 200   | 0     |  

### Summary of Positions:
| T (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|-------|-------|-------|  
| 0     | 0     | 0     |  
| 1     | 20    | -1.67 |  
| 2     | 40    | -3.33 |  
| 3     | 60    | -5    |  
| 4     | 80    | -5    |  
| 5     | 100   | -5    |  
| 6     | 120   | -5    |  
| 7     | 140   | -5    |  
| 8     | 160   | -3.33 |  
| 9     | 180   | -1.67 |  
| 10    | 200   | 0     |  

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed of 72 km/h and completes the maneuver within 10 seconds.
