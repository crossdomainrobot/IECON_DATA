To navigate around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll plan the lane transitions and estimate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals. Here's the step-by-step route planning:

---

### **Given:**
- **Starting point:** (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Obstruction:** (X, Y) = (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane:** Y = -5
- **Initial velocity:** 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum speed:** 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- **Time interval:** 1 second (T = 0 to T = 10)

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle transitions smoothly between lanes at a constant lateral speed.
2. The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout.
3. The lane change takes 2 seconds (from T = 3 to T = 5 for transitioning to the adjacent lane, and T = 7 to T = 9 for returning to the original lane).

---

### **Route Planning:**

1. **T = 0 to T = 3:**  
   - Vehicle travels straight in the outer lane.  
   - Position at T = 3:  
     \( X = 20 \times 3 = 60 \)  
     \( Y = 0 \)  
     **Position:** (60, 0)

2. **T = 3 to T = 5:**  
   - Vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
   - Lateral speed: \( \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \, \text{m/s} \)  
   - Position at T = 4:  
     \( X = 20 \times 4 = 80 \)  
     \( Y = -2.5 \)  
     **Position:** (80, -2.5)  
   - Position at T = 5:  
     \( X = 20 \times 5 = 100 \)  
     \( Y = -5 \)  
     **Position:** (100, -5)

3. **T = 5 to T = 7:**  
   - Vehicle continues in the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction.  
   - Position at T = 6:  
     \( X = 20 \times 6 = 120 \)  
     \( Y = -5 \)  
     **Position:** (120, -5)  
   - Position at T = 7:  
     \( X = 20 \times 7 = 140 \)  
     \( Y = -5 \)  
     **Position:** (140, -5)

4. **T = 7 to T = 9:**  
   - Vehicle transitions back to the original lane (Y = 0).  
   - Lateral speed: \( \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \, \text{m/s} \)  
   - Position at T = 8:  
     \( X = 20 \times 8 = 160 \)  
     \( Y = -2.5 \)  
     **Position:** (160, -2.5)  
   - Position at T = 9:  
     \( X = 20 \times 9 = 180 \)  
     \( Y = 0 \)  
     **Position:** (180, 0)

5. **T = 9 to T = 10:**  
   - Vehicle continues in the original lane.  
   - Position at T = 10:  
     \( X = 20 \times 10 = 200 \)  
     \( Y = 0 \)  
     **Position:** (200, 0)

### **Summary of Positions:**
| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|-----------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, 0)         |
| 2        | (40, 0)         |
| 3        | (60, 0)         |
| 4        | (80, -2.5)      |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -5)       |
| 7        | (140, -5)       |
| 8        | (160, -2.5)     |
| 9        | (180, 0)        |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

### **Key Points:**
- The vehicle bypasses the obstruction at X = 100 while in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
- The speed remains constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h), satisfying the minimum speed requirement.  
- The lane transitions are smooth and completed within the 10-second timeframe.
