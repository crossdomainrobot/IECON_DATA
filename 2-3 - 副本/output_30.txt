To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed exceeding 60 km/h, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into phases and calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals. Here¡¯s the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Given:**
- **Starting position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Obstruction position**: (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5
- **Initial speed**: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- **Time intervals**: T = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10 seconds

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle accelerates/decelerates smoothly during lane changes.
2. Lane changes take 2 seconds each (transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 and back).
3. The vehicle bypasses the obstruction between X = 90 and X = 110.

### **Route Plan:**

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2)**
- **Objective**: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.
- **Speed**: Maintained at 20 m/s (72 km/h).
- **X-position**: Increases linearly at 20 m/s.
- **Y-position**: Changes linearly from 0 to -5.

| T (s) | X (m)       | Y (m) |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| 0     | 0           | 0     |
| 1     | 20          | -2.5  |
| 2     | 40          | -5    |

---

#### **Phase 2: Bypass Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 8)**
- **Objective**: Remain in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while bypassing the obstruction (X = 100).
- **Speed**: Maintained at 20 m/s (72 km/h).
- **X-position**: Increases linearly at 20 m/s.

| T (s) | X (m)       | Y (m) |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| 3     | 60          | -5    |
| 4     | 80          | -5    |
| 5     | 100         | -5    |
| 6     | 120         | -5    |
| 7     | 140         | -5    |
| 8     | 160         | -5    |

---

#### **Phase 3: Lane Change Back to Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)**
- **Objective**: Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.
- **Speed**: Maintained at 20 m/s (72 km/h).
- **X-position**: Increases linearly at 20 m/s.
- **Y-position**: Changes linearly from -5 to 0.

| T (s) | X (m)       | Y (m) |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| 9     | 180         | -2.5  |
| 10    | 200         | 0     |

---

### **Summary of Positions:**

| T (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 0     | 0     | 0     |
| 1     | 20    | -2.5  |
| 2     | 40    | -5    |
| 3     | 60    | -5    |
| 4     | 80    | -5    |
| 5     | 100   | -5    |
| 6     | 120   | -5    |
| 7     | 140   | -5    |
| 8     | 160   | -5    |
| 9     | 180   | -2.5  |
| 10    | 200   | 0     |

### **Key Points:**
1. The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
2. Lane changes are completed smoothly over 2 seconds each.
3. The obstruction is bypassed between X = 90 and X = 110 (T = 4.5 to T = 5.5).
4. The vehicle returns to the original lane by T = 10 seconds.
