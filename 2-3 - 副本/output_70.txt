To plan your route and navigate around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into stages: transitioning to the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. We¡¯ll calculate your position at 1-second intervals, ensuring your speed remains above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).

### **Given:**
- **Initial position:** (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Obstruction position:** (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate:** Y = -5
- **Initial speed:** 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum speed:** 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. **Lane change duration:** Each lane transition (outer to inner and back) takes 3 seconds.
2. **Steady speed:** Maintain a constant speed of 20 m/s during the maneuver.
3. **Lateral movement:** Lateral displacement (Y) changes linearly during lane transitions.

### **Route Plan:**

#### **Stage 1: Transition to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 3)**
- **Lateral movement:** Move from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds.
- **Lateral speed:** ¦¤Y/¦¤t = (-5 - 0)/3 = -1.67 m/s
- **Longitudinal movement:** X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -1.67 |
| 2        | 40    | -3.33 |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |

---

#### **Stage 2: Bypass Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7)**
- **Lateral position:** Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
- **Longitudinal movement:** X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -5    |

---

#### **Stage 3: Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10)**
- **Lateral movement:** Move from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.
- **Lateral speed:** ¦¤Y/¦¤t = (0 - (-5))/3 = 1.67 m/s
- **Longitudinal movement:** X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 8        | 160   | -3.33 |
| 9        | 180   | -1.67 |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### **Summary of Positions:**

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -1.67 |
| 2        | 40    | -3.33 |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -5    |
| 8        | 160   | -3.33 |
| 9        | 180   | -1.67 |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### **Key Observations:**
1. **Speed:** Maintained at 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout, satisfying the minimum speed requirement.
2. **Obstruction bypass:** Successfully navigated around the obstruction at X = 100 while staying in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
3. **Lane transitions:** Completed smoothly within 3 seconds each.

This plan ensures a safe and efficient maneuver around the obstruction.
