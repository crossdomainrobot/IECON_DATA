To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):**  
   Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
2. **Bypass the Obstruction (X = 100):**  
   Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstruction.  
3. **Return to the Original Lane (Y = 0):**  
   Transition back to the outer lane (Y = 0) after bypassing the obstruction.

### Assumptions:
- **Initial Velocity:** 72 km/h = 20 m/s.  
- **Minimum Speed:** 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.  
- **Lane Change Duration:** Assume 2 seconds for each lane change (to and from the adjacent lane).  
- **Obstruction Position:** (X = 100, Y = 0).  
- **Time Intervals:** 1-second increments for simplicity.

### Route Planning:

#### Phase 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)  
- **Time:** T = 0 to T = 2 seconds.  
- **Lateral Movement:** Linear transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.  
- **Longitudinal Movement:** Constant speed of 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |  
| 2        | 40    | -5    |  

#### Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction (Y = -5)  
- **Time:** T = 2 to T = 6 seconds.  
- **Lateral Movement:** Stay in Y = -5.  
- **Longitudinal Movement:** Constant speed of 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    |  

#### Phase 3: Return to Original Lane (Y = 0)  
- **Time:** T = 6 to T = 8 seconds.  
- **Lateral Movement:** Linear transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.  
- **Longitudinal Movement:** Constant speed of 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |  
| 8        | 160   | 0     |  

#### Phase 4: Continue in Original Lane (Y = 0)  
- **Time:** T = 8 to T = 10 seconds.  
- **Lateral Movement:** Stay in Y = 0.  
- **Longitudinal Movement:** Constant speed of 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 9        | 180   | 0     |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |  

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |  
| 2        | 40    | -5    |  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    |  
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |  
| 8        | 160   | 0     |  
| 9        | 180   | 0     |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |  

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h while safely navigating around the obstruction.
