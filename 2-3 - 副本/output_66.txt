To construct a route planning for your vehicle, we'll break down the maneuver into three phases: transitioning to the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. We'll estimate the vehicle's position at 1-second intervals over the next 10 seconds.

### Assumptions:
1. **Initial Position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
2. **Obstruction Position**: (X, Y) = (100, 0)
3. **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5
4. **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
5. **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
6. **Time Intervals**: 1 second

### Phases:
1. **Transition to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)**:
   - The vehicle moves from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds.
   - Lateral velocity: \( \frac{-5}{3} \approx -1.67 \) m/s

2. **Bypass Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7 seconds)**:
   - The vehicle maintains Y = -5 while bypassing the obstruction at X = 100.

3. **Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds)**:
   - The vehicle moves from Y = -5 back to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.
   - Lateral velocity: \( \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67 \) m/s

### Position Estimates:

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -1.67 |
| 2        | 40    | -3.33 |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -5    |
| 8        | 160   | -3.33 |
| 9        | 180   | -1.67 |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### Explanation:
- **X-coordinate**: The vehicle moves at a constant speed of 20 m/s along the road.
- **Y-coordinate**: The vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane over 3 seconds, maintains the lane for 4 seconds, and then returns to the original lane over the next 3 seconds.

This plan ensures that the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h throughout the maneuver.
