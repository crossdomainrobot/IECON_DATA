To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Returning to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**  

### Assumptions:
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane)  
- Obstruction at (100, 0)  
- Lane change duration: 2 seconds (smooth transition)  
- Total maneuver time: 10 seconds  

### Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2)
- Start at (0, 0)  
- Move to (X, Y) = (40, -5) by T = 2  
  - X = velocity ¡Á time = 20 m/s ¡Á 2 s = 40 m  
  - Y transitions linearly from 0 to -5 over 2 seconds  

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)
- Continue in the adjacent lane (Y = -5)  
- Move from (40, -5) to (120, -5) by T = 6  
  - Distance to bypass obstruction: 100 m (X = 100) + 20 m buffer = 120 m  
  - Time = (120 m - 40 m) / 20 m/s = 4 seconds  

### Phase 3: Returning to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)
- Move from (120, -5) to (160, 0) by T = 8  
  - X = 20 m/s ¡Á 2 s = 40 m (total X = 120 + 40 = 160 m)  
  - Y transitions linearly from -5 to 0 over 2 seconds  

### Phase 4: Continuing in the Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)
- Move from (160, 0) to (200, 0) by T = 10  
  - X = 20 m/s ¡Á 2 s = 40 m (total X = 160 + 40 = 200 m)  
  - Y remains at 0  

### Position Estimates at Critical Intervals:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) | Description                     |  
|----------|-------|-------|---------------------------------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     | Start                           |  
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  | Lane change in progress         |  
| 2        | 40    | -5    | Adjacent lane reached           |  
| 3        | 60    | -5    | Bypassing obstruction           |  
| 4        | 80    | -5    | Bypassing obstruction           |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    | Obstruction bypassed            |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    | Approaching lane change back    |  
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  | Lane change back in progress    |  
| 8        | 160   | 0     | Original lane reached           |  
| 9        | 180   | 0     | Continuing in original lane     |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     | Maneuver complete               |  

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h and safely navigates around the obstruction.
