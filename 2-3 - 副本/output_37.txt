To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the process into phases: **lane transition**, **bypassing the obstruction**, and **returning to the original lane**. We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at 1-second intervals (T = 0 to T = 10), ensuring the speed remains above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).

### **Initial Conditions**
- **Starting point:** (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Obstruction location:** (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate:** Y = -5
- **Initial velocity:** 72 km/h = 20 m/s
- **Minimum speed:** 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s

---

### **Assumptions**
1. The vehicle takes **2 seconds** to transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) and vice versa.
2. The vehicle moves **linearly** in both X (forward) and Y (lateral) directions during transitions.
3. The vehicle bypasses the obstruction by staying in the adjacent lane for **2 seconds** (from X = 80 to X = 120).

### **Route Plan**

#### **Phase 1: Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2)**
- **X-direction:** Travels forward at 20 m/s.  
  \( X = 20 \times T \)
- **Y-direction:** Moves laterally from Y = 0 to Y = -5 linearly over 2 seconds.  
  \( Y = -2.5 \times T \)

| **Time (T)** | **X** | **Y** |
|--------------|-------|-------|
| 0            | 0     | 0     |
| 1            | 20    | -2.5  |
| 2            | 40    | -5    |

---

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 4)**
- **X-direction:** Continues forward at 20 m/s.  
  \( X = 40 + 20 \times (T - 2) \)
- **Y-direction:** Stays in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).

| **Time (T)** | **X** | **Y** |
|--------------|-------|-------|
| 2            | 40    | -5    |
| 3            | 60    | -5    |
| 4            | 80    | -5    |

---

#### **Phase 3: Returning to Original Lane (T = 4 to T = 6)**
- **X-direction:** Continues forward at 20 m/s.  
  \( X = 80 + 20 \times (T - 4) \)
- **Y-direction:** Moves laterally from Y = -5 to Y = 0 linearly over 2 seconds.  
  \( Y = -5 + 2.5 \times (T - 4) \)

| **Time (T)** | **X** | **Y** |
|--------------|-------|-------|
| 4            | 80    | -5    |
| 5            | 100   | -2.5  |
| 6            | 120   | 0     |

---

#### **Phase 4: Continuing in Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 10)**
- **X-direction:** Continues forward at 20 m/s.  
  \( X = 120 + 20 \times (T - 6) \)
- **Y-direction:** Stays in the original lane (Y = 0).

| **Time (T)** | **X** | **Y** |
|--------------|-------|-------|
| 6            | 120   | 0     |
| 7            | 140   | 0     |
| 8            | 160   | 0     |
| 9            | 180   | 0     |
| 10           | 200   | 0     |

### **Summary of Positions**
| **Time (T)** | **X** | **Y** |
|--------------|-------|-------|
| 0            | 0     | 0     |
| 1            | 20    | -2.5  |
| 2            | 40    | -5    |
| 3            | 60    | -5    |
| 4            | 80    | -5    |
| 5            | 100   | -2.5  |
| 6            | 120   | 0     |

### **Key Points**
1. The obstruction at (100, 0) is bypassed between T = 4 and T = 6.
2. The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout, satisfying the minimum speed requirement.
3. The lateral transitions occur smoothly over 2 seconds each.
