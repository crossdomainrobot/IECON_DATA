To construct a route planning for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break down the movement into critical intervals. The goal is to transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5), bypass the obstruction at X = 100, and then return to the original lane (Y = 0), all while maintaining a speed exceeding 60 km/h.

### Key Assumptions:
1. **Initial Position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
2. **Obstruction Position**: (X, Y) = (100, 0)
3. **Adjacent Lane**: Y = -5
4. **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s (converted for ease of calculation)
5. **Minimum Speed**: Must exceed 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s
6. **Time Intervals**: We¡¯ll evaluate every second (T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10)

### Plan:
1. **Lane Change**: Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) within a reasonable time frame.
2. **Bypass Obstruction**: Ensure the vehicle is in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) when X = 100.
3. **Return to Original Lane**: Transition back to the original lane (Y = 0) after bypassing the obstruction.

### Calculations:
- **Distance Traveled per Second**: At 20 m/s, the vehicle travels 20 meters every second.
- **Lane Change Timing**: Assume the lane change takes 2 seconds (T = 1 to T = 3).
- **Bypass Timing**: Ensure the vehicle is in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) at T = 5 (when X = 100).
- **Return Timing**: Transition back to the original lane (Y = 0) from T = 6 to T = 8.

### Route Planning:
| Time (T) | X (Distance) | Y (Lateral Position) | Notes |
|----------|--------------|----------------------|-------|
| 0        | 0            | 0                    | Initial position |
| 1        | 20           | -1.25                | Start lane change |
| 2        | 40           | -2.5                 | Mid lane change |
| 3        | 60           | -5                   | Fully in adjacent lane |
| 4        | 80           | -5                   | Bypassing obstruction |
| 5        | 100          | -5                   | Obstruction bypassed |
| 6        | 120          | -3.75                | Start returning to original lane |
| 7        | 140          | -1.25                | Mid return |
| 8        | 160          | 0                    | Fully back in original lane |
| 9        | 180          | 0                    | Continue straight |
| 10       | 200          | 0                    | Continue straight |

### Explanation:
1. **T = 0 to T = 3**: The vehicle transitions from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds, ensuring it¡¯s fully in the adjacent lane by T = 3.
2. **T = 4 to T = 5**: The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane while bypassing the obstruction at X = 100.
3. **T = 6 to T = 8**: The vehicle transitions back to the original lane, ensuring it¡¯s fully back by T = 8.
4. **T = 9 to T = 10**: The vehicle continues straight in the original lane.

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed exceeding 60 km/h (16.67 m/s) throughout the maneuver and safely navigates around the obstruction.
