To navigate around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll break down the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypass the obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Return to the original lane (Y = 0)**  

### Given:
- Initial speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s)  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)  
- Obstruction at (100, 0)  
- Adjacent lane at Y = -5  
- Time starts at T = 0  

### Assumptions:
- Smooth lane transitions (linear change in Y).  
- Constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.  
- Lane change duration: 2 seconds (1 second to transition to the adjacent lane, 1 second to return to the original lane).  

### Critical Positions:
#### Phase 1: Transition to the adjacent lane (T = 0 to T = 1)  
- At T = 0: (X, Y) = (0, 0)  
- At T = 1: (X, Y) = (20, -5)  

#### Phase 2: Bypass the obstruction (T = 1 to T = 5)  
- At T = 2: (X, Y) = (40, -5)  
- At T = 3: (X, Y) = (60, -5)  
- At T = 4: (X, Y) = (80, -5)  
- At T = 5: (X, Y) = (100, -5)  

#### Phase 3: Return to the original lane (T = 5 to T = 6)  
- At T = 6: (X, Y) = (120, 0)  

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| 0        | (0, 0)          |  
| 1        | (20, -5)        |  
| 2        | (40, -5)        |  
| 3        | (60, -5)        |  
| 4        | (80, -5)        |  
| 5        | (100, -5)       |  
| 6        | (120, 0)        |  

### Explanation:
1. **Transition to the adjacent lane (T = 0 to T = 1):**  
   - The vehicle moves 20 meters along the X-axis (20 m/s ¡Á 1 s).  
   - The Y-coordinate changes linearly from 0 to -5 over 1 second.  

2. **Bypass the obstruction (T = 1 to T = 5):**  
   - The vehicle continues straight in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
   - The X-coordinate increases by 20 meters every second.  

3. **Return to the original lane (T = 5 to T = 6):**  
   - The vehicle moves another 20 meters along the X-axis.  
   - The Y-coordinate changes linearly from -5 to 0 over 1 second.  

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
