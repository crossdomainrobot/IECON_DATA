To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:  
1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Returning to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**  

### Assumptions:
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.  
- Speed must exceed 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s at all times.  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = 0 to Y = -5).  
- Obstruction is at (100, 0).  
- Lane change duration: 2 seconds (smooth transition).  

### Calculations:
1. **Distance Traveled Along X-Axis**:  
   \( X(t) = X_0 + v \cdot t \), where \( v = 20 \, \text{m/s} \).  

2. **Lateral Movement Along Y-Axis**:  
   - Lane change to Y = -5: Linear transition over 2 seconds.  
   - Return to Y = 0: Linear transition over 2 seconds.  

3. **Critical Positions**:  
   - At T = 2s: Complete lane change to Y = -5.  
   - At T = 6s: Begin returning to Y = 0.  
   - At T = 8s: Complete return to Y = 0.  

### Route Plan:
| Time (s) | X (m)       | Y (m)       | Description                        |
|----------|-------------|-------------|------------------------------------|
| 0        | 0           | 0           | Start in the outer lane.           |
| 1        | 20          | -2.5        | Begin lane change.                 |
| 2        | 40          | -5          | Complete lane change.              |
| 3        | 60          | -5          | Bypassing obstruction.             |
| 4        | 80          | -5          | Bypassing obstruction.             |
| 5        | 100         | -5          | Pass obstruction at X = 100.       |
| 6        | 120         | -2.5        | Begin returning to original lane.  |
| 7        | 140         | -2.5        | Continue returning.                |
| 8        | 160         | 0           | Complete return to original lane.  |
| 9        | 180         | 0           | Continue in original lane.         |
| 10       | 200         | 0           | Continue in original lane.         |

### Explanation:
- **Lane Change**: Smooth transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.  
- **Bypassing Obstruction**: Remain in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing X = 100.  
- **Return to Original Lane**: Smooth transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.  
- **Speed**: Maintained at 20 m/s (72 km/h), exceeding the minimum requirement of 16.67 m/s (60 km/h).  

This plan ensures safe and efficient navigation around the obstruction while maintaining speed and smooth lane transitions.
