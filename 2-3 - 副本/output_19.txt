To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):**  
   Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) smoothly.  
2. **Bypass the Obstruction (X = 100):**  
   Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstruction.  
3. **Return to the Original Lane (Y = 0):**  
   Transition back to the outer lane (Y = 0) after bypassing the obstruction.  

### Assumptions:
- **Initial Velocity:** 72 km/h = 20 m/s.  
- **Minimum Speed:** Must exceed 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.  
- **Lane Width:** 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).  
- **Obstruction Location:** (X = 100, Y = 0).  
- **Time Intervals:** 1-second increments.  

### Route Planning:
We¡¯ll assume the lane changes take 2 seconds each and maintain a constant speed of 20 m/s.  

#### Phase 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2)  
- **T = 0:** (X = 0, Y = 0)  
- **T = 1:** (X = 20, Y = -2.5)  
- **T = 2:** (X = 40, Y = -5)  

#### Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)  
- **T = 3:** (X = 60, Y = -5)  
- **T = 4:** (X = 80, Y = -5)  
- **T = 5:** (X = 100, Y = -5)  
- **T = 6:** (X = 120, Y = -5)  

#### Phase 3: Return to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)  
- **T = 7:** (X = 140, Y = -2.5)  
- **T = 8:** (X = 160, Y = 0)  

#### Phase 4: Continue in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)  
- **T = 9:** (X = 180, Y = 0)  
- **T = 10:** (X = 200, Y = 0)  

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| 0        | (0, 0)          |  
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |  
| 2        | (40, -5)        |  
| 3        | (60, -5)        |  
| 4        | (80, -5)        |  
| 5        | (100, -5)       |  
| 6        | (120, -5)       |  
| 7        | (140, -2.5)     |  
| 8        | (160, 0)        |  
| 9        | (180, 0)        |  
| 10       | (200, 0)        |  

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h and completes the lane transitions smoothly.
