To construct a route planning for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into phases: **lane transition**, **bypassing the obstruction**, and **returning to the original lane**. We¡¯ll estimate the vehicle¡¯s position \((X, Y)\) at 1-second intervals, assuming constant velocity and smooth lane transitions.

---

### **Given:**
- **Initial position:** \((X, Y) = (0, 0)\)
- **Obstruction position:** \((100, 0)\)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate:** \(Y = -5\)
- **Initial velocity:** \(72 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s}\)
- **Minimum speed:** \(60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s}\)
- **Time interval:** \(T = 0\) to \(T = 10\) seconds

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of \(20 \, \text{m/s}\).
2. Lane transitions (lateral movement) occur linearly over 2 seconds.
3. The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane while bypassing the obstruction.

---

### **Route Planning:**

#### **Phase 1: Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)**
- The vehicle moves from \(Y = 0\) to \(Y = -5\) over 2 seconds.
- Lateral velocity: \(\frac{-5}{2} = -2.5 \, \text{m/s}\).
- Longitudinal velocity: \(20 \, \text{m/s}\).

| Time (s) | \(X\) (m) | \(Y\) (m) |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 0        | 0         | 0         |
| 1        | 20        | -2.5      |
| 2        | 40        | -5        |

---

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6 seconds)**
- The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (\(Y = -5\)) while bypassing the obstruction.
- Longitudinal velocity: \(20 \, \text{m/s}\).

| Time (s) | \(X\) (m) | \(Y\) (m) |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 3        | 60        | -5        |
| 4        | 80        | -5        |
| 5        | 100       | -5        |
| 6        | 120       | -5        |

---

#### **Phase 3: Returning to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)**
- The vehicle moves from \(Y = -5\) to \(Y = 0\) over 2 seconds.
- Lateral velocity: \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \, \text{m/s}\).
- Longitudinal velocity: \(20 \, \text{m/s}\).

| Time (s) | \(X\) (m) | \(Y\) (m) |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 7        | 140       | -2.5      |
| 8        | 160       | 0         |

---

#### **Phase 4: Continuing in the Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds)**
- The vehicle remains in the original lane (\(Y = 0\)).
- Longitudinal velocity: \(20 \, \text{m/s}\).

| Time (s) | \(X\) (m) | \(Y\) (m) |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 9        | 180       | 0         |
| 10       | 200       | 0         |

---

### **Summary of Positions:**

| Time (s) | \(X\) (m) | \(Y\) (m) |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 0        | 0         | 0         |
| 1        | 20        | -2.5      |
| 2        | 40        | -5        |
| 3        | 60        | -5        |
| 4        | 80        | -5        |
| 5        | 100       | -5        |
| 6        | 120       | -5        |
| 7        | 140       | -2.5      |
| 8        | 160       | 0         |
| 9        | 180       | 0         |
| 10       | 200       | 0         |

### **Key Points:**
1. The vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane by \(T = 2\) seconds.
2. It bypasses the obstruction at \(X = 100\) while staying in the adjacent lane.
3. It returns to the original lane by \(T = 8\) seconds.
4. The vehicle maintains a speed of \(20 \, \text{m/s}\) throughout, satisfying the minimum speed requirement.
