To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):**  
   Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) smoothly.  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100):**  
   Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstruction.  
3. **Return to the Original Lane (Y = 0):**  
   Transition back to the outer lane (Y = 0) after bypassing the obstruction.

### Assumptions:
- **Initial Velocity:** 72 km/h = 20 m/s.  
- **Minimum Speed:** Must exceed 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.  
- **Lane Change Duration:** Assume each lane change takes 2 seconds.  
- **Obstruction Position:** (X = 100, Y = 0).  
- **Time Intervals:** We¡¯ll calculate positions at T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 seconds.

### Step-by-Step Plan:

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2)**  
- **Lateral Movement:** Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.  
- **Lateral Velocity:** ¦¤Y = -5 / 2 = -2.5 m/s.  
- **Longitudinal Movement:** Maintain speed of 20 m/s.  

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)**  
- **Lateral Position:** Stay at Y = -5.  
- **Longitudinal Movement:** Continue at 20 m/s.  

#### **Phase 3: Return to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)**  
- **Lateral Movement:** Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.  
- **Lateral Velocity:** ¦¤Y = 5 / 2 = 2.5 m/s.  
- **Longitudinal Movement:** Maintain speed of 20 m/s.  

#### **Phase 4: Continue in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)**  
- **Lateral Position:** Stay at Y = 0.  
- **Longitudinal Movement:** Continue at 20 m/s.

| 6        | 120              | -5          | Preparing to return            |
| 7        | 140              | -2.5        | Lane change in progress        |
| 8        | 160              | 0           | Fully back in original lane    |
| 9        | 180              | 0           | Continuing in original lane    |
| 10       | 200              | 0           | Continuing in original lane    |

### Key Points:
- The vehicle bypasses the obstruction at T = 5 seconds (X = 100, Y = -5).  
- Speed remains constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h), satisfying the minimum speed requirement.  
- Lane changes are completed smoothly within 2 seconds each.  
- The vehicle returns to the original lane by T = 8 seconds.  

This plan ensures safe and efficient navigation around the obstruction while maintaining speed and lane discipline.
