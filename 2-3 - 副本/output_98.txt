To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):** Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
2. **Bypass the Obstruction:** Maintain the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until passing the obstruction at X = 100.
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0):** Transition from the adjacent lane (Y = -5) back to the outer lane (Y = 0).

### Assumptions:
- The vehicle¡¯s initial velocity is 72 km/h (20 m/s).
- The vehicle must maintain a speed exceeding 60 km/h (16.67 m/s) throughout.
- The lane change takes approximately 2 seconds each (to and from the adjacent lane).
- The vehicle travels in a straight line during lane changes (simplification).

### Route Plan:

#### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)
- **Time (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds):**
  - At T = 0: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
  - At T = 1: (X, Y) = (20, -2.5) (halfway through lane change)
  - At T = 2: (X, Y) = (40, -5) (fully in the adjacent lane)

#### Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction (Y = -5)
- **Time (T = 2 to T = 6 seconds):**
  - At T = 3: (X, Y) = (60, -5)
  - At T = 4: (X, Y) = (80, -5)
  - At T = 5: (X, Y) = (100, -5) (passing the obstruction)
  - At T = 6: (X, Y) = (120, -5)

#### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)
- **Time (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds):**
  - At T = 7: (X, Y) = (140, -2.5) (halfway through lane change)
  - At T = 8: (X, Y) = (160, 0) (fully back in the original lane)

#### Final Straight Path (Y = 0)
- **Time (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds):**
  - At T = 9: (X, Y) = (180, 0)
  - At T = 10: (X, Y) = (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions:
- T = 0: (0, 0)
- T = 1: (20, -2.5)
- T = 2: (40, -5)
- T = 3: (60, -5)
- T = 4: (80, -5)
- T = 5: (100, -5)
- T = 6: (120, -5)
- T = 7: (140, -2.5)
- T = 8: (160, 0)
- T = 9: (180, 0)
- T = 10: (200, 0)

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
