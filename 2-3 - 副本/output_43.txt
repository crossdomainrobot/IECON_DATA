To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):**  
   Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
2. **Bypass the Obstruction (X = 100):**  
   Stay in the adjacent lane while passing the obstruction.  
3. **Return to the Original Lane (Y = 0):**  
   Transition back to the outer lane after bypassing the obstruction.

### Assumptions:
- Vehicle speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s).  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).  
- Obstruction is at X = 100 meters.  
- Lane changes take 2 seconds each.  
- Speed remains constant at 72 km/h throughout.

### Route Plan:
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at 1-second intervals (T = 0 to T = 10).

#### Phase 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2)
- At T = 0: (X, Y) = (0, 0).  
- At T = 1: (X, Y) = (20, -2.5).  
- At T = 2: (X, Y) = (40, -5).  

#### Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)
- At T = 3: (X, Y) = (60, -5).  
- At T = 4: (X, Y) = (80, -5).  
- At T = 5: (X, Y) = (100, -5).  
- At T = 6: (X, Y) = (120, -5).  

#### Phase 3: Return to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)
- At T = 7: (X, Y) = (140, -2.5).  
- At T = 8: (X, Y) = (160, 0).  

#### Phase 4: Continue in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)
- At T = 9: (X, Y) = (180, 0).  
- At T = 10: (X, Y) = (200, 0).  

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (T) | X (meters) | Y (meters) |  
|----------|------------|------------|  
| 0        | 0          | 0          |  
| 1        | 20         | -2.5       |  
| 2        | 40         | -5         |  
| 3        | 60         | -5         |  
| 4        | 80         | -5         |  
| 5        | 100        | -5         |  
| 6        | 120        | -5         |  
| 7        | 140        | -2.5       |  
| 8        | 160        | 0          |  
| 9        | 180        | 0          |  
| 10       | 200        | 0          |  

### Explanation:
- **Lane Change:** The vehicle transitions from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds, moving laterally at 2.5 m/s.  
- **Bypass:** The vehicle stays in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstruction at X = 100.  
- **Return:** The vehicle transitions back to Y = 0 over 2 seconds, moving laterally at 2.5 m/s.  
- **Speed:** The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout.  

This plan ensures the obstruction is safely bypassed while maintaining the required speed.
