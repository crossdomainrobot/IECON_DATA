To construct a route planning for your vehicle, we'll break down the maneuver into critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. Here¡¯s the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Assumptions and Initial Conditions**
- **Starting position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Obstruction position**: (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane**: Y = -5
- **Initial speed**: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- **Time step**: 1 second

---

### **Route Planning**
1. **Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 3)**:
   - Move from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds.
   - Maintain speed at 20 m/s.
   - At T = 3, position: (60, -5).

2. **Bypass Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7)**:
   - Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while bypassing the obstruction at X = 100.
   - Maintain speed at 20 m/s.
   - At T = 7, position: (140, -5).

3. **Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10)**:
   - Move from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.
   - Maintain speed at 20 m/s.
   - At T = 10, position: (200, 0).

### **Position Estimates at Critical Intervals**
| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -1.67 |
| 2        | 40    | -3.33 |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -5    |
| 8        | 160   | -3.33 |
| 9        | 180   | -1.67 |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### **Explanation**
- **Lane Transition**: Smoothly transition to the adjacent lane over 3 seconds, ensuring lateral movement is gradual.
- **Bypass Obstruction**: Stay in the adjacent lane while passing the obstruction at X = 100.
- **Return to Original Lane**: Transition back to the original lane over 3 seconds.

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h and safely navigates around the obstruction.
