To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**  

### Assumptions:
- Initial speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s)  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane)  
- Obstruction is at (100, 0)  
- Time step: 1 second  

### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)
- Duration: 3 seconds (smooth lane change)  
- Lateral movement: From Y = 0 to Y = -5  
- Speed: Maintained at 20 m/s  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -1.67 |  
| 2        | 40    | -3.33 |  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)
- Duration: 2 seconds (passing the obstruction)  
- Lateral position: Y = -5  
- Speed: Maintained at 20 m/s  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  

### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)
- Duration: 3 seconds (smooth lane change)  
- Lateral movement: From Y = -5 to Y = 0  
- Speed: Maintained at 20 m/s  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 6        | 120   | -3.33 |  
| 7        | 140   | -1.67 |  
| 8        | 160   | 0     |  

### Final Positions:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 9        | 180   | 0     |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |  

### Summary:
- The vehicle changes lanes smoothly over 3 seconds, bypasses the obstruction at X = 100, and returns to the original lane by T = 8 seconds.  
- Speed is maintained at 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.  
- The vehicle¡¯s position at critical intervals is outlined above.
