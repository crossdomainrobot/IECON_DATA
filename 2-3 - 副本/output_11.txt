To plan the route, we need to calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at critical intervals while transitioning to the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. Here¡¯s how we can approach this:

---

### **Key Details**
1. **Initial Position (T = 0):** (X, Y) = (0, 0)
2. **Obstruction Position:** (X, Y) = (100, 0)
3. **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate:** Y = -5
4. **Initial Velocity:** 72 km/h = 20 m/s
5. **Minimum Speed:** Must exceed 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s
6. **Time Frame:** 10 seconds

---

### **Assumptions**
1. The lane change is smooth and takes place over a short distance.
2. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout.
3. The lane change duration is 2 seconds (1 second to move into the adjacent lane and 1 second to return).

### **Route Planning**

#### **Step 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane**
- **Time:** T = 0 to T = 1
- **Movement:** Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5
- **X-Position:** X = 20 m/s ¡Á 1 s = 20 m
- **Position at T = 1:** (20, -5)

#### **Step 2: Bypass Obstruction in Adjacent Lane**
- **Time:** T = 1 to T = 5
- **Movement:** Continue in the adjacent lane (Y = -5)
- **X-Position:** X = 20 m/s ¡Á 4 s = 80 m (from T = 1 to T = 5)
- **Position at T = 2:** (40, -5)
- **Position at T = 3:** (60, -5)
- **Position at T = 4:** (80, -5)
- **Position at T = 5:** (100, -5)

#### **Step 3: Lane Change Back to Original Lane**
- **Time:** T = 5 to T = 6
- **Movement:** Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0
- **X-Position:** X = 20 m/s ¡Á 1 s = 20 m (from T = 5 to T = 6)
- **Position at T = 6:** (120, 0)

#### **Step 4: Continue in Original Lane**
- **Time:** T = 6 to T = 10
- **Movement:** Continue in the original lane (Y = 0)
- **X-Position:** X = 20 m/s ¡Á 4 s = 80 m (from T = 6 to T = 10)
- **Position at T = 7:** (140, 0)
- **Position at T = 8:** (160, 0)
- **Position at T = 9:** (180, 0)
- **Position at T = 10:** (200, 0)

### **Summary of Positions**
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|-----------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -5)        |
| 2        | (40, -5)        |
| 3        | (60, -5)        |
| 4        | (80, -5)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, 0)        |
| 7        | (140, 0)        |
| 8        | (160, 0)        |
| 9        | (180, 0)        |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

### **Verification**
1. Speed: The vehicle maintains 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout, exceeding the minimum requirement of 16.67 m/s (60 km/h).
2. Obstruction Bypass: The vehicle is in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) when X = 100, ensuring the obstruction is avoided.
3. Lane Transitions: Smooth lane changes ensure safety and efficiency.
