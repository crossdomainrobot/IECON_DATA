To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):**  
   Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) smoothly.  
2. **Bypass the Obstruction (X = 100):**  
   Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstruction.  
3. **Return to the Original Lane (Y = 0):**  
   Transition back to the outer lane (Y = 0) after bypassing the obstruction.

### Assumptions:
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h (20 m/s).  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).  
- Obstruction at X = 100 meters.  
- Time step: 1 second.  

### Route Planning:
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at each second (T = 0 to T = 10).

#### Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 3)
- **T = 0:** (X, Y) = (0, 0)  
- **T = 1:** (X, Y) = (20, -1.67)  
- **T = 2:** (X, Y) = (40, -3.33)  
- **T = 3:** (X, Y) = (60, -5)  

#### Phase 2: Bypass Obstruction (T = 4 to T = 6)
- **T = 4:** (X, Y) = (80, -5)  
- **T = 5:** (X, Y) = (100, -5)  
- **T = 6:** (X, Y) = (120, -5)  

#### Phase 3: Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10)
- **T = 7:** (X, Y) = (140, -3.33)  
- **T = 8:** (X, Y) = (160, -1.67)  
- **T = 9:** (X, Y) = (180, 0)  
- **T = 10:** (X, Y) = (200, 0)  

### Explanation:
1. **Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 3):**  
   - The vehicle moves laterally from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds.  
   - Lateral speed: \( \frac{5 \text{ m}}{3 \text{ s}} \approx 1.67 \text{ m/s} \).  
   - Longitudinal speed: 20 m/s (72 km/h).  

2. **Bypass Obstruction (T = 4 to T = 6):**  
   - The vehicle stays in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstruction at X = 100.  

3. **Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10):**  
   - The vehicle moves laterally from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.  
   - Lateral speed: \( \frac{5 \text{ m}}{3 \text{ s}} \approx 1.67 \text{ m/s} \).  
   - Longitudinal speed: 20 m/s (72 km/h).  

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -1.67 |  
| 2        | 40    | -3.33 |  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    |  
| 7        | 140   | -3.33 |  
| 8        | 160   | -1.67 |  
| 9        | 180   | 0     |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |  

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
