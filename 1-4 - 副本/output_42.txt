To plan the route and estimate the vehicle's position at critical intervals, we'll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5)**: This involves changing lanes smoothly.
2. **Bypass the obstruction**: Maintain the new lane until the obstruction is cleared.
3. **Return to the original lane (Y = 0)**: Transition back to the original lane after passing the obstruction.

### Assumptions:
- **Initial velocity**: 72 km/h (20 m/s).
- **Minimum speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).
- **Time steps**: 1-second intervals.
- **Lane width**: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).
- **Obstruction position**: (100, 0).

### Phase 1: Transition to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)
We¡¯ll assume the lane change takes **3 seconds**. During this time, the vehicle moves laterally from Y = 0 to Y = -5 while maintaining a speed of 20 m/s.

#### Positions:
- **T = 0 s**: (0, 0)
- **T = 1 s**: (20, -1.67)  
  (X: 20 m, Y: -1.67 m, as the lane change is gradual)
- **T = 2 s**: (40, -3.33)
- **T = 3 s**: (60, -5)

### Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction
Once in the adjacent lane, the vehicle continues straight, bypassing the obstruction at X = 100. This phase lasts until the vehicle clears the obstruction.

#### Positions:
- **T = 4 s**: (80, -5)
- **T = 5 s**: (100, -5)  
  (At this point, the vehicle is directly alongside the obstruction.)
- **T = 6 s**: (120, -5)  
  (The vehicle has cleared the obstruction.)

### Phase 3: Return to the Original Lane (Y = 0)
The vehicle transitions back to the original lane over **3 seconds**.

#### Positions:
- **T = 7 s**: (140, -3.33)
- **T = 8 s**: (160, -1.67)
- **T = 9 s**: (180, 0)

### Final Position:
- **T = 10 s**: (200, 0)  
  (The vehicle is back in the original lane and continues straight.)

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|-----------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -1.67)     |
| 2        | (40, -3.33)     |
| 3        | (60, -5)        |
| 4        | (80, -5)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -5)       |
| 7        | (140, -3.33)    |
| 8        | (160, -1.67)    |
| 9        | (180, 0)        |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

### Key Points:
- The lane changes are assumed to take 3 seconds each, ensuring smooth transitions.
- The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s throughout, exceeding the minimum requirement of 16.67 m/s.
- The obstruction is bypassed safely by transitioning to the adjacent lane and returning afterward.
