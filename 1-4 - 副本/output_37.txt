To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the vehicle's movement into key phases: lane change, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. Here's the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Given:**
- Starting position: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- Obstruction at (100, 0)
- Adjacent lane Y-coordinate: Y = -5
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- Time interval: 10 seconds

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout.
2. Each lane change takes 2 seconds (smooth transition).
3. The vehicle spends 6 seconds in the adjacent lane to bypass the obstruction.

### **Route Plan:**

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)**
- Transition from (0, 0) to (40, -5).
- At T = 1 second: (20, -2.5)
- At T = 2 seconds: (40, -5)

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 8 seconds)**
- Move in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) from (40, -5) to (160, -5).
- At T = 3 seconds: (60, -5)
- At T = 4 seconds: (80, -5)
- At T = 5 seconds: (100, -5) (bypassing the obstruction)
- At T = 6 seconds: (120, -5)
- At T = 7 seconds: (140, -5)
- At T = 8 seconds: (160, -5)

#### **Phase 3: Lane Change (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds)**
- Transition from (160, -5) to (200, 0).
- At T = 9 seconds: (180, -2.5)
- At T = 10 seconds: (200, 0)

### **Summary of Positions at Critical Intervals:**
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y)  |
|----------|------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |
| 2        | (40, -5)        |
| 3        | (60, -5)        |
| 4        | (80, -5)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -5)       |
| 7        | (140, -5)       |
| 8        | (160, -5)       |
| 9        | (180, -2.5)     |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

### **Key Points:**
1. The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s throughout.
2. The obstruction is bypassed safely in the adjacent lane.
3. The vehicle returns to the original lane after 10 seconds.
