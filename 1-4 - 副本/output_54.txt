To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we need to calculate the vehicle's position over time while ensuring a smooth lane transition and maintaining a speed above 60 km/h. Here's the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Given:**
1. **Initial position:** (X, Y) = (0, 0)
2. **Obstruction position:** (100, 0)
3. **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate:** Y = -5
4. **Initial velocity:** 72 km/h (20 m/s)
5. **Minimum speed:** 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
6. **Time interval:** 10 seconds (T = 0 to T = 10)

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The lane change takes **3 seconds** (T = 1 to T = 4).
2. The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) from T = 4 to T = 8 to bypass the obstruction.
3. The vehicle returns to the original lane (Y = 0) in **2 seconds** (T = 8 to T = 10).
4. The speed remains constant at 72 km/h (20 m/s) throughout.

### **Route Plan:**
1. **T = 0:**
   - Position: (0, 0)
   - Action: Start in the outer lane.

2. **T = 1:**
   - Position: (20, 0)
   - Action: Begin transitioning to the adjacent lane.

3. **T = 2:**
   - Position: (40, -1.67)
   - Action: Continue transitioning to the adjacent lane.

4. **T = 3:**
   - Position: (60, -3.33)
   - Action: Nearly complete the transition to the adjacent lane.

5. **T = 4:**
   - Position: (80, -5)
   - Action: Fully in the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction.

6. **T = 5:**
   - Position: (100, -5)
   - Action: Continue in the adjacent lane.

7. **T = 6:**
   - Position: (120, -5)
   - Action: Continue in the adjacent lane.

8. **T = 7:**
   - Position: (140, -5)
   - Action: Continue in the adjacent lane.

9. **T = 8:**
   - Position: (160, -3.33)
   - Action: Begin transitioning back to the original lane.

10. **T = 9:**
    - Position: (180, -1.67)
    - Action: Continue transitioning back to the original lane.

11. **T = 10:**
    - Position: (200, 0)
    - Action: Fully back in the original lane.

### **Summary of Positions:**
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|-----------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, 0)         |
| 2        | (40, -1.67)     |
| 3        | (60, -3.33)     |
| 4        | (80, -5)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -5)       |
| 7        | (140, -5)       |
| 8        | (160, -3.33)    |
| 9        | (180, -1.67)    |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

This plan ensures a smooth lane transition while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h and bypassing the obstruction safely.
