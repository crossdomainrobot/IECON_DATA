To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into stages and calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals. Here's the plan:

### Assumptions:
1. **Initial Position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0).
2. **Obstruction Position**: (100, 0).
3. **Adjacent Lane Position**: Y = -5.
4. **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h (20 m/s).
5. **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).
6. **Time Frame**: 10 seconds.

### Maneuver Stages:
1. **Lane Change to Adjacent Lane**: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.
2. **Bypass Obstruction**: Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until X > 100.
3. **Lane Change Back to Original Lane**: Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.

### Position Calculations:
- The vehicle moves at a constant speed of 20 m/s along the X-axis.
- Lateral movement (Y-axis) is linear during lane changes.

#### Positions at 1-Second Intervals:

| Time (s) | X-Position (m) | Y-Position (m) |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| T = 0    | 0              | 0              |
| T = 1    | 20             | -2.5           |
| T = 2    | 40             | -5             |
| T = 3    | 60             | -5             |
| T = 4    | 80             | -5             |
| T = 5    | 100            | -5             |
| T = 6    | 120            | -5             |
| T = 7    | 140            | -2.5           |
| T = 8    | 160            | 0              |
| T = 9    | 180            | 0              |
| T = 10   | 200            | 0              |

### Explanation:
1. **T = 0 to T = 2**: The vehicle changes lanes linearly from Y = 0 to Y = -5 while moving forward at 20 m/s.
2. **T = 2 to T = 6**: The vehicle stays in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) and bypasses the obstruction at X = 100.
3. **T = 6 to T = 8**: The vehicle transitions back to the original lane (Y = 0) while continuing to move forward.
4. **T = 8 to T = 10**: The vehicle continues in the original lane (Y = 0).

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h and safely navigates around the obstruction.
