To navigate around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll break down the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane**: Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
2. **Bypass the Obstruction**: Continue in the adjacent lane until the obstruction is safely passed.  
3. **Return to the Original Lane**: Transition back to the outer lane (Y = 0).  

We¡¯ll assume a constant speed of **72 km/h (20 m/s)** for simplicity. The obstruction is at **X = 100 m**, and the adjacent lane is at **Y = -5 m**. We¡¯ll plan the maneuver over **10 seconds**.

### **Phase 1: Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)**  
- **Time**: 0 to 3 seconds  
- **Lateral Movement**: Smoothly transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5.  
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Continue moving forward at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -1.67 |  
| 2        | 40    | -3.33 |  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  

---

### **Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7 seconds)**  
- **Time**: 3 to 7 seconds  
- **Lateral Movement**: Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Continue moving forward at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    |  
| 7        | 140   | -5    |  

---

### **Phase 3: Return to the Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds)**  
- **Time**: 7 to 10 seconds  
- **Lateral Movement**: Smoothly transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0.  
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Continue moving forward at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 8        | 160   | -3.33 |  
| 9        | 180   | -1.67 |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### **Summary of Critical Positions**  
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -1.67 |  
| 2        | 40    | -3.33 |  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    |  
| 7        | 140   | -5    |  
| 8        | 160   | -3.33 |  
| 9        | 180   | -1.67 |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### **Key Observations**  
1. The obstruction is bypassed safely at **T = 5 seconds**, when the vehicle is at (100, -5).  
2. The vehicle returns to the original lane by **T = 10 seconds**, having traveled 200 meters.  
3. The speed remains constant at **72 km/h (20 m/s)** throughout the maneuver.  

This plan ensures the vehicle avoids the obstruction while maintaining a safe and consistent speed.
