To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into stages and calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals. We¡¯ll ensure the speed remains above 60 km/h and the lane transitions are smooth.

---

### **Given Data**
- Initial position: \( (X, Y) = (0, 0) \).
- Obstruction position: \( (100, 0) \).
- Adjacent lane Y-coordinate: \( Y = -5 \).
- Initial velocity: \( 72 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \).
- Minimum speed: \( 60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \).

---

### **Assumptions**
1. **Lane Transition Time**: We assume it takes 2 seconds to transition between lanes (smooth lateral movement).
2. **Bypass Distance**: We¡¯ll move to the adjacent lane before reaching the obstruction and return after passing it.
3. **Speed Profile**: The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout.

---

### **Route Plan**
1. **T = 0 to T = 2**: Transition from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \) (outer lane to adjacent lane).
2. **T = 2 to T = 6**: Travel in the adjacent lane (\( Y = -5 \)) to bypass the obstruction.
3. **T = 6 to T = 8**: Transition back from \( Y = -5 \) to \( Y = 0 \) (adjacent lane to outer lane).
4. **T = 8 to T = 10**: Continue traveling in the outer lane (\( Y = 0 \)).

---

### **Position Calculations**
- **Lateral Movement**: \( Y \) changes linearly during lane transitions (2 seconds each).
- **Longitudinal Movement**: \( X \) increases at a rate of 20 m/s.

### **Positions at 1-second Intervals**

| Time (s) | \( X \) (m) | \( Y \) (m) | Description                     |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------------------------|
| 0        | 0           | 0           | Start in outer lane.            |
| 1        | 20          | -2.5        | Transitioning to adjacent lane. |
| 2        | 40          | -5          | Fully in adjacent lane.         |
| 3        | 60          | -5          | Bypassing obstruction.          |
| 4        | 80          | -5          | Bypassing obstruction.          |
| 5        | 100         | -5          | Passed obstruction.             |
| 6        | 120         | -5          | Preparing to transition back.   |
| 7        | 140         | -2.5        | Transitioning back to outer lane.|
| 8        | 160         | 0           | Fully in outer lane.            |
| 9        | 180         | 0           | Continuing in outer lane.       |
| 10       | 200         | 0           | Continuing in outer lane.       |

### **Key Points**
- The obstruction is bypassed between \( T = 2 \) and \( T = 6 \).
- The speed remains constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h), satisfying the minimum speed requirement.
- Lane transitions are smooth and take 2 seconds each.

This plan ensures safe navigation around the obstruction while maintaining speed and lane discipline.
