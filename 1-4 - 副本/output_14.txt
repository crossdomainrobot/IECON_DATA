To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
   - Transition from (0, 0) to (X, -5).  
   - Assume this takes 3 seconds.

2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
   - Travel in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until passing the obstruction.  
   - Assume this takes 4 seconds.

3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**  
   - Transition from (X, -5) to (X, 0).  
   - Assume this takes 3 seconds.

### Assumptions:
- Initial speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s).  
- Maintain speed above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).  
- Lane changes are smooth and linear over 3 seconds.  
- Obstruction is at X = 100 meters.

### Route Plan:
#### **Phase 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to 3 seconds)**  
- **T = 0s**: (0, 0)  
- **T = 1s**: (20, -1.67)  
- **T = 2s**: (40, -3.33)  
- **T = 3s**: (60, -5)  

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 3 to 7 seconds)**  
- **T = 4s**: (80, -5)  
- **T = 5s**: (100, -5)  
- **T = 6s**: (120, -5)  
- **T = 7s**: (140, -5)  

#### **Phase 3: Lane Change Back to Original Lane (T = 7 to 10 seconds)**  
- **T = 8s**: (160, -3.33)  
- **T = 9s**: (180, -1.67)  
- **T = 10s**: (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| 0        | (0, 0)          |  
| 1        | (20, -1.67)     |  
| 2        | (40, -3.33)     |  
| 3        | (60, -5)        |  
| 4        | (80, -5)        |  
| 5        | (100, -5)       |  
| 6        | (120, -5)       |  
| 7        | (140, -5)       |  
| 8        | (160, -3.33)    |  
| 9        | (180, -1.67)    |  
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

### Notes:
- The lane changes are assumed to be linear and take 3 seconds each.  
- The speed is maintained at 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.  
- The obstruction is bypassed between T = 5s and T = 6s.  
- The total distance traveled in 10 seconds is 200 meters.  

This plan ensures the obstruction is safely bypassed while maintaining the required speed.
