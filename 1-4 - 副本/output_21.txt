To plan the route and estimate the vehicle¡¯s position at critical intervals, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**  

### Key Assumptions:
- The vehicle¡¯s initial velocity is **72 km/h**, which is **20 m/s** (since 72 km/h = 72,000 m/3,600 s = 20 m/s).  
- The vehicle must maintain a speed **> 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)** throughout the maneuver.  
- The adjacent lane is at **Y = -5**, and the original lane is at **Y = 0**.  
- The obstruction is at **(100, 0)**.  
- The lane changes are assumed to take **2 seconds each**, with a smooth lateral transition.

### Route Planning:

#### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)  
- **Time Interval:** T = 0 to T = 2  
- **Lateral Movement:** The vehicle moves from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.  
- **Position at T = 1:**  
  - X = 20 m/s ¡Á 1 s = 20 m  
  - Y = linear interpolation: -2.5 (halfway between 0 and -5)  
  - Position: (20, -2.5)  
- **Position at T = 2:**  
  - X = 20 m/s ¡Á 2 s = 40 m  
  - Y = -5  
  - Position: (40, -5)  

#### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)  
- **Time Interval:** T = 2 to T = 6  
- **Lateral Movement:** The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
- **Position at T = 3:**  
  - X = 20 m/s ¡Á 3 s = 60 m  
  - Y = -5  
  - Position: (60, -5)  
- **Position at T = 4:**  
  - X = 20 m/s ¡Á 4 s = 80 m  
  - Y = -5  
  - Position: (80, -5)  
- **Position at T = 5:**  
  - X = 20 m/s ¡Á 5 s = 100 m  
  - Y = -5  
  - Position: (100, -5)  
- **Position at T = 6:**  
  - X = 20 m/s ¡Á 6 s = 120 m  
  - Y = -5  
  - Position: (120, -5)  

#### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)  
- **Time Interval:** T = 6 to T = 8  
- **Lateral Movement:** The vehicle moves from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.  
- **Position at T = 7:**  
  - X = 20 m/s ¡Á 7 s = 140 m  
  - Y = linear interpolation: -2.5 (halfway between -5 and 0)  
  - Position: (140, -2.5)  
- **Position at T = 8:**  
  - X = 20 m/s ¡Á 8 s = 160 m  
  - Y = 0  
  - Position: (160, 0)  

#### Continued Travel in the Original Lane  
- **Time Interval:** T = 8 to T = 10  
- **Lateral Movement:** The vehicle remains in the original lane (Y = 0).  
- **Position at T = 9:**  
  - X = 20 m/s ¡Á 9 s = 180 m  
  - Y = 0  
  - Position: (180, 0)  
- **Position at T = 10:**  
  - X = 20 m/s ¡Á 10 s = 200 m  
  - Y = 0  
  - Position: (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|----------------|  
| T = 0    | (0, 0)         |  
| T = 1    | (20, -2.5)     |  
| T = 2    | (40, -5)       |  
| T = 3    | (60, -5)       |  
| T = 4    | (80, -5)       |  
| T = 5    | (100, -5)      |  
| T = 6    | (120, -5)      |  
| T = 7    | (140, -2.5)    |  
| T = 8    | (160, 0)       |  
| T = 9    | (180, 0)       |  
| T = 10   | (200, 0)       |  

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed > 60 km/h and safely returns to the original lane.
