To plan the route, we'll break down the maneuver into three phases: transitioning to the adjacent lane, maintaining the adjacent lane while bypassing the obstruction, and transitioning back to the original lane. We'll estimate the vehicle's position at 1-second intervals over the next 10 seconds.

### Key Assumptions:
1. **Initial Position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0) at T = 0.
2. **Obstruction Position**: (X, Y) = (100, 0).
3. **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5.
4. **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
5. **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.
6. **Lane Change Duration**: Assume 3 seconds for each lane transition (to and from the adjacent lane).

### Route Planning:
#### **Phase 1: Transition to the Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 3)**
During this phase, the vehicle moves laterally from Y = 0 to Y = -5 while maintaining a speed of 20 m/s.

- **T = 0**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **T = 1**: (X, Y) = (20, -1.67)
- **T = 2**: (X, Y) = (40, -3.33)
- **T = 3**: (X, Y) = (60, -5)

#### **Phase 2: Maintain the Adjacent Lane (T = 3 to T = 7)**
The vehicle continues in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while bypassing the obstruction at X = 100.

- **T = 4**: (X, Y) = (80, -5)
- **T = 5**: (X, Y) = (100, -5)
- **T = 6**: (X, Y) = (120, -5)
- **T = 7**: (X, Y) = (140, -5)

#### **Phase 3: Transition Back to the Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10)**
The vehicle moves laterally from Y = -5 back to Y = 0 while maintaining a speed of 20 m/s.

- **T = 8**: (X, Y) = (160, -3.33)
- **T = 9**: (X, Y) = (180, -1.67)
- **T = 10**: (X, Y) = (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -1.67 |
| 2        | 40    | -3.33 |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -5    |
| 8        | 160   | -3.33 |
| 9        | 180   | -1.67 |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### Notes:
- The speed remains constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h), ensuring it stays above the minimum required speed of 16.67 m/s (60 km/h).
- The lane transitions are smooth and take 3 seconds each, ensuring safety and stability.
- The obstruction is bypassed without any risk of collision.
