To plan the route for your vehicle, we'll break down the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane**: Transition from Y = 0 (outer lane) to Y = -5 (adjacent lane).
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction**: Maintain Y = -5 while moving past X = 100.
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane**: Transition from Y = -5 back to Y = 0.

We'll assume smooth and constant acceleration during lane changes and a constant speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) while bypassing the obstruction.

### **Key Assumptions**
- **Time for Lane Change**: 2 seconds (1 second to change into the adjacent lane, 1 second to change back).
- **Speed**: Maintain 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout.
- **Obstruction Position**: (100, 0).
- **Adjacent Lane Position**: Y = -5.

### **Route Plan**

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 1)**
- **Time Interval**: T = 0 to T = 1.
- **Y-Position**: Moves linearly from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
- **X-Position**: Moves at 20 m/s.
- **Positions**:
  - T = 0: (0, 0)
  - T = 1: (20, -5)

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 1 to T = 4)**
- **Time Interval**: T = 1 to T = 4.
- **Y-Position**: Maintains Y = -5.
- **X-Position**: Moves at 20 m/s.
- **Positions**:
  - T = 2: (40, -5)
  - T = 3: (60, -5)
  - T = 4: (80, -5)

#### **Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (T = 4 to T = 5)**
- **Time Interval**: T = 4 to T = 5.
- **Y-Position**: Moves linearly from Y = -5 to Y = 0.
- **X-Position**: Moves at 20 m/s.
- **Positions**:
  - T = 5: (100, 0)

### **Summary of Positions**
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -5    |
| 2        | 40    | -5    |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | 0     |

### **Explanation**
1. **Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 1)**: The vehicle smoothly transitions to the adjacent lane while maintaining speed.
2. **Bypassing Obstruction (T = 1 to T = 4)**: The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane, ensuring the obstruction at X = 100 is safely bypassed.
3. **Lane Change Back (T = 4 to T = 5)**: The vehicle smoothly transitions back to the original lane.

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h and safely navigates around the obstruction.
