To plan the route for the vehicle to bypass the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we'll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction in the Adjacent Lane**  
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane**

### Key Assumptions:
- Initial speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s).
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).
- The obstruction is at (100, 0).
- The adjacent lane is at Y = -5.
- The lane change takes approximately 2 seconds each (outward and return).
- The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 72 km/h during the maneuver.

### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2)
- At T = 0: Position = (0, 0).
- At T = 1: Position = (20, -2.5) (halfway through the lane change).
- At T = 2: Position = (40, -5) (fully in the adjacent lane).

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction in the Adjacent Lane (T = 2 to T = 6)
- The obstruction is at X = 100. To bypass it, the vehicle must stay in the adjacent lane until X > 100.
- At T = 3: Position = (60, -5).
- At T = 4: Position = (80, -5).
- At T = 5: Position = (100, -5).
- At T = 6: Position = (120, -5) (obstruction bypassed).

### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)
- At T = 7: Position = (140, -2.5) (halfway through the lane change).
- At T = 8: Position = (160, 0) (fully back in the original lane).

### Final Phase: Continuing in the Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)
- At T = 9: Position = (180, 0).
- At T = 10: Position = (200, 0).

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)           |
| 1        | (20, -2.5)       |
| 2        | (40, -5)         |
| 3        | (60, -5)         |
| 4        | (80, -5)         |
| 5        | (100, -5)        |
| 6        | (120, -5)        |
| 7        | (140, -2.5)      |
| 8        | (160, 0)         |
| 9        | (180, 0)         |
| 10       | (200, 0)         |

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h, successfully bypasses the obstruction, and returns to the original lane within 10 seconds.
