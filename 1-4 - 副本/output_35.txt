To plan the vehicle's route around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we'll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction**
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**

### Key Assumptions:
- Vehicle speed: 72 km/h = 20 m/s (constant speed for simplicity).
- Lane width: 5 meters (so Y = 0 to Y = -5 is one lane change).
- Obstruction is at (100, 0).
- Lane changes take approximately 2 seconds each (a smooth transition).

### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)
- Start at (0, 0) at T = 0.
- Lane change begins at T = 0 and ends at T = 2.
- During this time, the vehicle moves forward at 20 m/s while transitioning laterally from Y = 0 to Y = -5.

#### Positions:
- T = 1: (20, -2.5) ！ Midway through the lane change.
- T = 2: (40, -5) ！ Lane change complete.

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction
- From T = 2 to T = 6, the vehicle continues in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) to bypass the obstruction at (100, 0).
- The vehicle travels at 20 m/s.

#### Positions:
- T = 3: (60, -5)
- T = 4: (80, -5)
- T = 5: (100, -5) ！ Now bypassing the obstruction.
- T = 6: (120, -5) ！ Clear of the obstruction.

### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)
- Lane change begins at T = 6 and ends at T = 8.
- The vehicle transitions from Y = -5 to Y = 0 while moving forward at 20 m/s.

#### Positions:
- T = 7: (140, -2.5) ！ Midway through the lane change.
- T = 8: (160, 0) ！ Lane change complete.

### Final Positions:
- T = 9: (180, 0)
- T = 10: (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions (X, Y) at Critical Intervals:
- T = 0: (0, 0)
- T = 1: (20, -2.5)
- T = 2: (40, -5)
- T = 3: (60, -5)
- T = 4: (80, -5)
- T = 5: (100, -5)
- T = 6: (120, -5)
- T = 7: (140, -2.5)
- T = 8: (160, 0)
- T = 9: (180, 0)
- T = 10: (200, 0)

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed of 72 km/h, successfully bypasses the obstruction, and returns to the original lane within 10 seconds.
