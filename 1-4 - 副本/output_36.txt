To plan the route, we¡¯ll break down the maneuver into phases: **lane transition**, **bypassing the obstruction**, and **returning to the original lane**. We¡¯ll assume constant speed for simplicity and calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals. Here¡¯s the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Given:**
- **Initial position:** (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Obstruction position:** (X, Y) = (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate:** Y = -5
- **Initial velocity:** 72 km/h = 20 m/s
- **Minimum speed:** 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s (but we¡¯ll assume constant speed of 20 m/s)
- **Time interval:** 1 second (T = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10)

---

### **Route Plan:**

1. **Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2):**
   - Move from Y = 0 to Y = -5 (adjacent lane) over 2 seconds.
   - Lateral velocity: -2.5 m/s (since 5 meters / 2 seconds = 2.5 m/s).

2. **Bypassing Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 5):**
   - Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while moving forward.
   - By T = 5, the vehicle should have passed the obstruction at X = 100.

3. **Returning to Original Lane (T = 5 to T = 7):**
   - Move from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.
   - Lateral velocity: +2.5 m/s.

4. **Continuing in Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10):**
   - Stay in the original lane (Y = 0) and continue forward.

### **Position Estimates:**

| Time (T) | X (m) = 20 * T | Y (m) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|----------------|-------|------------------|
| 0        | 0              | 0     | (0, 0)           |
| 1        | 20             | -2.5  | (20, -2.5)       |
| 2        | 40             | -5    | (40, -5)         |
| 3        | 60             | -5    | (60, -5)         |
| 4        | 80             | -5    | (80, -5)         |
| 5        | 100            | -5    | (100, -5)        |
| 6        | 120            | -2.5  | (120, -2.5)      |
| 7        | 140            | 0     | (140, 0)         |
| 8        | 160            | 0     | (160, 0)         |
| 9        | 180            | 0     | (180, 0)         |
| 10       | 200            | 0     | (200, 0)         |

### **Key Points:**
- The lane transitions are smooth and completed within 2 seconds each.
- The obstruction is bypassed by T = 5, and the vehicle returns to the original lane by T = 7.
- The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
