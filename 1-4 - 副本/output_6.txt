To plan the route for your vehicle to navigate around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break down the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5)**:  
   This involves a lateral shift from Y = 0 to Y = -5 while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.

2. **Bypass the obstruction (X = 100)**:  
   Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstruction.

3. **Return to the original lane (Y = 0)**:  
   Shift back from Y = -5 to Y = 0.

We¡¯ll assume a constant speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) for simplicity. Here¡¯s the route plan:

---

### Phase 1: Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5)  
- **Time**: T = 0 to T = 2 seconds  
- **Lateral movement**: From Y = 0 to Y = -5 (assume linear transition over 2 seconds).  
- **Longitudinal movement**: X = 0 + (20 m/s ¡Á t).  

Positions:  
- T = 1 s: (20, -2.5)  
- T = 2 s: (40, -5)  

---

### Phase 2: Bypass the obstruction (Y = -5)  
- **Time**: T = 2 to T = 7 seconds  
- **Lateral movement**: Stay at Y = -5.  
- **Longitudinal movement**: X = 40 + (20 m/s ¡Á (t - 2)).  

Positions:  
- T = 3 s: (60, -5)  
- T = 4 s: (80, -5)  
- T = 5 s: (100, -5)  
- T = 6 s: (120, -5)  
- T = 7 s: (140, -5)  

---

### Phase 3: Return to the original lane (Y = 0)  
- **Time**: T = 7 to T = 9 seconds  
- **Lateral movement**: From Y = -5 to Y = 0 (assume linear transition over 2 seconds).  
- **Longitudinal movement**: X = 140 + (20 m/s ¡Á (t - 7)).  

Positions:  
- T = 8 s: (160, -2.5)  
- T = 9 s: (180, 0)  

---

### Final Position at T = 10 seconds  
- **Lateral movement**: Stay at Y = 0.  
- **Longitudinal movement**: X = 180 + (20 m/s ¡Á 1).  

Position:  
- T = 10 s: (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions (X, Y) at Critical Intervals:  
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |  
| 2        | (40, -5)        |  
| 3        | (60, -5)        |  
| 4        | (80, -5)        |  
| 5        | (100, -5)       |  
| 6        | (120, -5)       |  
| 7        | (140, -5)       |  
| 8        | (160, -2.5)     |  
| 9        | (180, 0)        |  
| 10       | (200, 0)        |  

This plan ensures the vehicle safely navigates around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
