To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we'll break the maneuver into phases: **lane change to the adjacent lane**, **bypassing the obstruction**, and **returning to the original lane**. Here's the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Given Parameters**
- **Initial position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Obstruction position**: (X, Y) = (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5
- **Initial speed**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s
- **Minimum speed**: 60 km/h ¡Ö 16.67 m/s
- **Time frame**: 10 seconds

---

### **Assumptions**
1. The lane change takes 3 seconds (smooth transition).
2. The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane until it has bypassed the obstruction (X > 100).
3. The return to the original lane takes another 3 seconds.
4. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s throughout.

### **Route Plan**

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to 3 seconds)**
- **Lateral movement**: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds.
- **Longitudinal movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -1.67 |
| 2        | 40    | -3.33 |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |

---

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 3 to 6 seconds)**
- **Lateral movement**: Remain in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
- **Longitudinal movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |

---

#### **Phase 3: Returning to Original Lane (T = 6 to 9 seconds)**
- **Lateral movement**: Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.
- **Longitudinal movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -3.33 |
| 8        | 160   | -1.67 |
| 9        | 180   | 0     |

---

#### **Phase 4: Continuing in Original Lane (T = 9 to 10 seconds)**
- **Lateral movement**: Remain in the original lane (Y = 0).
- **Longitudinal movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 9        | 180   | 0     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

---

### **Summary of Positions**

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m)      |
|----------|-------|------------|
| 0        | 0     | 0          |
| 1        | 20    | -1.67      |
| 2        | 40    | -3.33      |
| 3        | 60    | -5         |
| 4        | 80    | -5         |
| 5        | 100   | -5         |
| 6        | 120   | -5         |
| 7        | 140   | -3.33      |
| 8        | 160   | -1.67      |
| 9        | 180   | 0          |
| 10       | 200   | 0          |

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h and smoothly transitions between lanes.
