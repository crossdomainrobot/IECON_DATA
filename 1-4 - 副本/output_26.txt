To navigate around the obstruction and return to the original lane while maintaining a speed exceeding 60 km/h, we can break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):**  
   - This phase involves transitioning from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
   - Assume a smooth lateral movement over 2 seconds.

2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100):**  
   - Maintain the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstruction.  
   - This phase lasts until the vehicle is clear of the obstruction.

3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0):**  
   - Transition from the adjacent lane (Y = -5) back to the original lane (Y = 0).  
   - Assume another smooth lateral movement over 2 seconds.

### Key Assumptions:
- Initial speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s).  
- Speed is maintained at 20 m/s throughout.  
- Obstruction is at X = 100 m.  
- Lane transitions take 2 seconds each.  
- Time intervals: T = 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 seconds.

### Route Planning:

#### Phase 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2)
- **T = 0 s:** (X, Y) = (0, 0)  
- **T = 1 s:** (X, Y) = (20, -2.5)  
- **T = 2 s:** (X, Y) = (40, -5)  

#### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)
- **T = 3 s:** (X, Y) = (60, -5)  
- **T = 4 s:** (X, Y) = (80, -5)  
- **T = 5 s:** (X, Y) = (100, -5)  
- **T = 6 s:** (X, Y) = (120, -5)  

#### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)
- **T = 7 s:** (X, Y) = (140, -2.5)  
- **T = 8 s:** (X, Y) = (160, 0)  

#### Phase 4: Continuing in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)
- **T = 9 s:** (X, Y) = (180, 0)  
- **T = 10 s:** (X, Y) = (200, 0)  

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |
| 2        | 40    | -5    |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |
| 8        | 160   | 0     |
| 9        | 180   | 0     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

This plan ensures the vehicle safely navigates around the obstruction while maintaining a speed exceeding 60 km/h.
