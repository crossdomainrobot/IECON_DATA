To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, let¡¯s break down the steps and calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at critical intervals. We¡¯ll assume the vehicle moves smoothly and completes the lane transitions within 10 seconds.

---

### **Given:**
- **Starting position:** \( (X, Y) = (0, 0) \)
- **Obstruction position:** \( (100, 0) \)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate:** \( Y = -5 \)
- **Initial velocity:** \( 72 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \)
- **Minimum speed:** \( 60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \)
- **Time intervals:** \( T = 1, 2, 3, \dots, 10 \) seconds

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \) (72 km/h).
2. The lane transition (from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \)) takes **3 seconds**.
3. The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (\( Y = -5 \)) until it bypasses the obstruction (\( X = 100 \)).
4. The return transition (from \( Y = -5 \) to \( Y = 0 \)) takes another **3 seconds**.
5. The total maneuver takes **10 seconds**.

---

### **Route Plan:**

#### **Step 1: Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)**
- The vehicle moves from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \) over 3 seconds.
- Lateral movement: \( \Delta Y = -5 \, \text{meters} \), completed linearly in 3 seconds.
- At each second:
  - \( Y = 0 + \Delta Y \cdot \frac{T}{3} \)

#### **Step 2: Bypass Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7 seconds)**
- The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (\( Y = -5 \)) while bypassing the obstruction.

#### **Step 3: Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds)**
- The vehicle moves from \( Y = -5 \) to \( Y = 0 \) over 3 seconds.
- Lateral movement: \( \Delta Y = 5 \, \text{meters} \), completed linearly in 3 seconds.
- At each second:
  - \( Y = -5 + \Delta Y \cdot \frac{T - 7}{3} \)

### **Position Calculations:**

The vehicle¡¯s \( X \)-position increases at a constant rate of \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \). The \( Y \)-position changes as described above.

| Time (s) | \( X \) (m)       | \( Y \) (m)       |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| \( T = 0 \) | \( 0 \)             | \( 0 \)             |
| \( T = 1 \) | \( 20 \)            | \( -1.67 \)         |
| \( T = 2 \) | \( 40 \)            | \( -3.33 \)         |
| \( T = 3 \) | \( 60 \)            | \( -5 \)             |
| \( T = 4 \) | \( 80 \)            | \( -5 \)             |
| \( T = 5 \) | \( 100 \)           | \( -5 \)             |
| \( T = 6 \) | \( 120 \)           | \( -5 \)             |
| \( T = 7 \) | \( 140 \)           | \( -5 \)             |
| \( T = 8 \) | \( 160 \)           | \( -3.33 \)         |
| \( T = 9 \) | \( 180 \)           | \( -1.67 \)         |
| \( T = 10 \) | \( 200 \)           | \( 0 \)             |

---

### **Summary:**
- The vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane between \( T = 0 \) and \( T = 3 \) seconds.
- It bypasses the obstruction at \( X = 100 \) meters (\( T = 5 \) seconds) while staying in the adjacent lane.
- It returns to the original lane between \( T = 7 \) and \( T = 10 \) seconds.
- The vehicle¡¯s speed remains constant at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \) (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
