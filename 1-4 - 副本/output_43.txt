To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the maneuver into key steps and estimate the vehicle's position at 1-second intervals. Here's the plan:

---

### **Given Data**
- **Initial Position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Obstruction Position**: (100, 0)
- **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5
- **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- **Time Interval**: 1 second

---

### **Assumptions**
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h).
2. The lane change takes 2 seconds, during which the vehicle moves laterally at a constant rate.
3. The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane for 3 seconds to bypass the obstruction.
4. The vehicle returns to the original lane in 2 seconds.

### **Step-by-Step Plan**

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2)**
- **Lateral Movement**: From Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.
  - Lateral velocity = (-5 - 0) / 2 = -2.5 m/s.
- **Longitudinal Movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.
- **Positions**:
  - T = 0: (0, 0)
  - T = 1: (20, -2.5)
  - T = 2: (40, -5)

#### **Phase 2: Bypass Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 5)**
- **Lateral Movement**: Stay at Y = -5.
- **Longitudinal Movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.
- **Positions**:
  - T = 3: (60, -5)
  - T = 4: (80, -5)
  - T = 5: (100, -5)

#### **Phase 3: Lane Return (T = 5 to T = 7)**
- **Lateral Movement**: From Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.
  - Lateral velocity = (0 - (-5)) / 2 = 2.5 m/s.
- **Longitudinal Movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.
- **Positions**:
  - T = 6: (120, -2.5)
  - T = 7: (140, 0)

### **Final Route Plan**
Here¡¯s the vehicle¡¯s position at each second:

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |
| 2        | 40    | -5    |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -2.5  |
| 7        | 140   | 0     |

### **Verification**
- Speed is maintained at 20 m/s (72 km/h), exceeding the minimum requirement of 16.67 m/s (60 km/h).
- The obstruction at (100, 0) is bypassed while the vehicle is in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
- The vehicle returns to the original lane after bypassing the obstruction.

This plan ensures a smooth and safe maneuver around the obstruction.
