To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we need to model the vehicle¡¯s movement in both the X (longitudinal) and Y (lateral) directions. Here¡¯s how we¡¯ll approach it:

---

### **Assumptions**
1. **Initial Position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0).
2. **Obstruction Position**: (100, 0).
3. **Adjacent Lane Position**: Y = -5.
4. **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h (20 m/s).
5. **Minimum Speed**: Must exceed 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).
6. **Time Step**: 1 second intervals.

---

### **Plan**
1. **Lane Change**: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.
2. **Bypass Obstruction**: Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstruction at X = 100.
3. **Return to Original Lane**: Transition back from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.

### **Calculations**
#### **Longitudinal Movement (X-direction)**
- The vehicle travels at 20 m/s (72 km/h), so X increases by 20 meters every second.

#### **Lateral Movement (Y-direction)**
- Lane change occurs over 2 seconds, so Y changes linearly:
  - From T = 0 to T = 2: Y transitions from 0 to -5.
  - From T = 8 to T = 10: Y transitions from -5 to 0.

### **Position Estimates**
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) | Description                          |
|----------|-------|-------|--------------------------------------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     | Starting position.                   |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  | Lane change in progress.             |
| 2        | 40    | -5    | Fully in adjacent lane.              |
| 3        | 60    | -5    | Bypassing obstruction.               |
| 4        | 80    | -5    | Bypassing obstruction.               |
| 5        | 100   | -5    | Passing obstruction.                 |
| 6        | 120   | -5    | Bypassing obstruction.               |
| 7        | 140   | -5    | Bypassing obstruction.               |
| 8        | 160   | -2.5  | Returning to original lane.          |
| 9        | 180   | -1.25 | Returning to original lane.          |
| 10       | 200   | 0     | Fully back in original lane.         |

### **Explanation**
1. **Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2)**:
   - Y transitions from 0 to -5 over 2 seconds.
   - X increases by 20 meters each second.

2. **Bypassing Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 8)**:
   - Y remains at -5 (adjacent lane).
   - X increases by 20 meters each second.

3. **Returning to Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)**:
   - Y transitions from -5 to 0 over 2 seconds.
   - X increases by 20 meters each second.

### **Speed Constraint**
The vehicle¡¯s speed remains at 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout, which satisfies the requirement of exceeding 60 km/h.

This route plan ensures the vehicle safely navigates around the obstruction while maintaining the required speed.
