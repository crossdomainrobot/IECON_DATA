To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).**
2. **Bypass the obstruction (X = 100) while staying in the adjacent lane.**
3. **Return to the original lane (Y = 0).**

### Given:
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.
- Obstruction at (100, 0).
- Adjacent lane Y-coordinate: -5.
- Time interval: 10 seconds.

### Assumptions:
- The vehicle accelerates or decelerates smoothly to ensure the speed stays above 60 km/h.
- Lane changes take 2 seconds each (1 second to initiate and 1 second to stabilize).
- The vehicle travels at a constant speed of 20 m/s during straight sections.

### Route Plan:

#### Phase 1: Transition to the adjacent lane (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)
- At T = 0: Position = (0, 0).
- At T = 1: Position = (20, -2.5) (initiating lane change).
- At T = 2: Position = (40, -5) (lane change complete).

#### Phase 2: Bypass the obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6 seconds)
- At T = 3: Position = (60, -5).
- At T = 4: Position = (80, -5).
- At T = 5: Position = (100, -5) (bypassing obstruction).
- At T = 6: Position = (120, -5).

#### Phase 3: Return to the original lane (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)
- At T = 7: Position = (140, -2.5) (initiating lane change).
- At T = 8: Position = (160, 0) (lane change complete).

#### Phase 4: Continue in the original lane (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds)
- At T = 9: Position = (180, 0).
- At T = 10: Position = (200, 0).

### Summary of Positions:
- T = 0: (0, 0)
- T = 1: (20, -2.5)
- T = 2: (40, -5)
- T = 3: (60, -5)
- T = 4: (80, -5)
- T = 5: (100, -5)
- T = 6: (120, -5)
- T = 7: (140, -2.5)
- T = 8: (160, 0)
- T = 9: (180, 0)
- T = 10: (200, 0)

### Key Points:
- The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s throughout.
- Lane changes are completed smoothly within 2 seconds.
- The obstruction at (100, 0) is bypassed by staying in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
