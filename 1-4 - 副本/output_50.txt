To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we need to calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at critical intervals while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h. Here¡¯s the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Assumptions and Initial Conditions**
1. **Starting Point**: (X, Y) = (0, 0) at T = 0.
2. **Obstruction Location**: (X, Y) = (100, 0).
3. **Adjacent Lane**: Y = -5.
4. **Initial Speed**: 72 km/h (20 m/s).
5. **Minimum Speed**: Must exceed 60 km/h (16.67 m/s) throughout.

---

### **Steps for Lane Transition**
1. **Lane Change**: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
2. **Bypass Obstruction**: Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until X > 100.
3. **Return to Original Lane**: Transition back from Y = -5 to Y = 0.

### **Time Intervals and Positions**
We¡¯ll calculate positions at 1-second intervals (T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10). The vehicle moves at a constant speed of 20 m/s along the X-axis. For simplicity, assume the lateral (Y-axis) transition is linear and takes 2 seconds in each direction (lane change and return).

### **Position Calculations**
| Time (T) | X-position (m) | Y-position (m) | Notes                              |
|----------|----------------|----------------|------------------------------------|
| 0        | 0              | 0              | Starting point.                    |
| 1        | 20             | -1.25          | Begin lane change.                 |
| 2        | 40             | -2.5           | Continue lane change.              |
| 3        | 60             | -5             | Lane change complete.              |
| 4        | 80             | -5             | Stay in adjacent lane.             |
| 5        | 100            | -5             | Reach obstruction.                 |
| 6        | 120            | -5             | Bypass obstruction.                |
| 7        | 140            | -3.75          | Begin return to original lane.     |
| 8        | 160            | -2.5           | Continue return.                   |
| 9        | 180            | -1.25          | Continue return.                   |
| 10       | 200            | 0              | Return to original lane complete.  |

### **Explanation of Calculations**
1. **X-position**: At 20 m/s, the vehicle travels 20 meters every second.
2. **Y-position (Lane Change)**:
   - Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.
   - Rate of change: (-5 m) / 2 s = -2.5 m/s.
3. **Y-position (Return)**:
   - Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.
   - Rate of change: (5 m) / 2 s = 2.5 m/s.

### **Verification of Speed**
The vehicle¡¯s speed remains constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h) along the X-axis, which satisfies the requirement of exceeding 60 km/h.

This plan ensures the vehicle safely navigates around the obstruction while maintaining the required speed.
