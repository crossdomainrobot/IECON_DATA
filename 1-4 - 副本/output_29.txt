To plan the route for your vehicle, we'll break down the maneuver into three phases: transitioning to the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. We'll estimate the vehicle's position at 1-second intervals over the next 10 seconds.

### Key Parameters:
- **Initial velocity**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s
- **Minimum speed**: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s
- **Obstruction location**: (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5
- **Time interval**: 1 second

### Assumptions:
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s throughout the maneuver.
2. Lane changes occur smoothly over 2 seconds (1 second to transition into the adjacent lane and 1 second to return to the original lane).
3. The obstruction is bypassed between T = 5 and T = 6 seconds.

### Route Plan:
1. **T = 0 to T = 2**: Transition to the adjacent lane (Y moves from 0 to -5).
2. **T = 2 to T = 5**: Travel in the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction.
3. **T = 5 to T = 7**: Transition back to the original lane (Y moves from -5 to 0).
4. **T = 7 to T = 10**: Continue traveling in the original lane.

### Position Estimates:
| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m)         | Description                          |
|----------|-------|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| T = 0    | 0     | 0             | Starting point                       |
| T = 1    | 20    | -2.5          | Transitioning to adjacent lane       |
| T = 2    | 40    | -5            | Fully in adjacent lane               |
| T = 3    | 60    | -5            | Bypassing obstruction                |
| T = 4    | 80    | -5            | Bypassing obstruction                |
| T = 5    | 100   | -5            | Obstruction bypassed                 |
| T = 6    | 120   | -2.5          | Transitioning back to original lane  |
| T = 7    | 140   | 0             | Fully in original lane               |
| T = 8    | 160   | 0             | Continuing in original lane          |
| T = 9    | 180   | 0             | Continuing in original lane          |
| T = 10   | 200   | 0             | Continuing in original lane          |

### Explanation:
1. **Lane Transition**: The Y-coordinate changes linearly from 0 to -5 over 2 seconds.
2. **Bypassing Obstruction**: The vehicle travels in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) from T = 2 to T = 5, bypassing the obstruction at X = 100.
3. **Return to Original Lane**: The Y-coordinate changes linearly from -5 to 0 over 2 seconds (T = 5 to T = 7).
4. **Continuing Journey**: The vehicle maintains its original lane (Y = 0) after T = 7.

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h and safely navigates around the obstruction.
