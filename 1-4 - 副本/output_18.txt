To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds):**  
   Move from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7 seconds):**  
   Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstruction at X = 100.  
3. **Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds):**  
   Move back from the adjacent lane (Y = -5) to the outer lane (Y = 0).  

### Assumptions:
- Speed is maintained at **72 km/h (20 m/s)** throughout the maneuver.  
- Lane width is **5 meters** (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).  
- Obstruction is at **X = 100 meters**.  
- Time intervals are **1 second**.  

### Vehicle Position Over Time:
The vehicle¡¯s X-coordinate increases linearly at 20 m/s, while the Y-coordinate changes during lane transitions.  

#### Phase 1: Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)
At T = 0, the vehicle is at (0, 0).  
By T = 3, it moves to Y = -5.  
Y-coordinate changes linearly: **Y = -5/3 * T**.  

#### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7 seconds)
The vehicle stays in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while bypassing the obstruction at X = 100.  

#### Phase 3: Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds)
By T = 10, the vehicle returns to Y = 0.  
Y-coordinate changes linearly: **Y = -5 + 5/3 * (T - 7)**.  

### Route Plan:
| Time (s) | X (m)       | Y (m)       |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| T = 0    | 0           | 0           |
| T = 1    | 20          | -1.67       |
| T = 2    | 40          | -3.33       |
| T = 3    | 60          | -5          |
| T = 4    | 80          | -5          |
| T = 5    | 100         | -5          |
| T = 6    | 120         | -5          |
| T = 7    | 140         | -5          |
| T = 8    | 160         | -3.33       |
| T = 9    | 180         | -1.67       |
| T = 10   | 200         | 0           |

### Explanation:
1. **Lane Transition:**  
   - From T = 0 to T = 3, the vehicle moves laterally from Y = 0 to Y = -5 while traveling forward at 20 m/s.  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction:**  
   - From T = 3 to T = 7, the vehicle stays in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) and passes the obstruction at X = 100.  
3. **Return to Original Lane:**  
   - From T = 7 to T = 10, the vehicle moves laterally back to Y = 0 while continuing forward at 20 m/s.  

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed exceeding 60 km/h and safely navigates around the obstruction.
