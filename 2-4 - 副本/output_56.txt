To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the vehicle¡¯s movement into three phases:

### **Phase 1: Transition to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
The vehicle starts at (0, 0) and needs to move laterally to Y = -5.  

### **Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
The vehicle must remain in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstruction at X = 100.  

### **Phase 3: Return to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**  
After bypassing the obstruction, the vehicle transitions back to the original lane (Y = 0).

### **Assumptions**  
1. **Speed**: The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) throughout.  
2. **Lane Transition Time**: Each lane transition (Phase 1 and Phase 3) takes 2 seconds.  
3. **Obstruction Bypass**: The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane for 6 seconds to ensure it fully bypasses the obstruction.

### **Route Plan**  
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at 1-second intervals over the next 10 seconds.  

#### **Phase 1: Transition to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2)**  
- **Lateral Movement**: Y transitions linearly from 0 to -5 over 2 seconds.  
- **Longitudinal Movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |  
| 2        | 40    | -5    |  

#### **Phase 2: Bypass Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 8)**  
- **Lateral Movement**: Y remains constant at -5.  
- **Longitudinal Movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    |  
| 7        | 140   | -5    |  
| 8        | 160   | -5    |  

#### **Phase 3: Return to Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)**  
- **Lateral Movement**: Y transitions linearly from -5 to 0 over 2 seconds.  
- **Longitudinal Movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 9        | 180   | -2.5  |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### **Summary of Positions**  
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |  
| 2        | 40    | -5    |  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    |  
| 7        | 140   | -5    |  
| 8        | 160   | -5    |  
| 9        | 180   | -2.5  |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### **Key Points**  
1. The vehicle successfully bypasses the obstruction at X = 100 while maintaining a speed of 72 km/h.  
2. The lane transitions are smooth and completed within the 10-second timeframe.  
3. The vehicle returns to the original lane (Y = 0) at T = 10 seconds.
