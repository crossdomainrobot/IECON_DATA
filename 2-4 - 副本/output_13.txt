To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the maneuver into key phases: transitioning to the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. We'll track the vehicle's position (X, Y) at 1-second intervals, ensuring the speed remains above 60 km/h throughout.

### Assumptions:
- **Initial velocity**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
- **Obstruction position**: (100, 0).
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5.
- **Time intervals**: T = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10 seconds.

### Phases:
1. **Lane transition (T = 0 to T = 3)**:
   - Move from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds.
   - Lateral velocity: \( \Delta Y = \frac{-5}{3} \approx -1.67 \, \text{m/s} \).

2. **Bypass the obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7)**:
   - Maintain Y = -5 while traveling past X = 100.

3. **Return to the original lane (T = 7 to T = 10)**:
   - Move from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.
   - Lateral velocity: \( \Delta Y = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67 \, \text{m/s} \).

### Position Estimation:
- **X-coordinate**: \( X = X_0 + v \cdot t \), where \( v = 20 \, \text{m/s} \).
- **Y-coordinate**: Adjusted based on the phase.

#### Critical Positions:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) | Phase                |
|----------|-------|-------|----------------------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     | Start                |
| 1        | 20    | -1.67 | Lane transition      |
| 2        | 40    | -3.33 | Lane transition      |
| 3        | 60    | -5    | Lane transition end  |
| 4        | 80    | -5    | Bypassing obstruction|
| 5        | 100   | -5    | Bypassing obstruction|
| 6        | 120   | -5    | Bypassing obstruction|
| 7        | 140   | -5    | Bypassing end        |
| 8        | 160   | -3.33 | Return transition    |
| 9        | 180   | -1.67 | Return transition    |
| 10       | 200   | 0     | Return complete      |

### Verification:
- **Speed**: Maintained at 20 m/s (72 km/h) > 60 km/h.
- **Obstruction bypass**: The vehicle stays in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing X = 100.
- **Smooth transitions**: Lane changes are completed within 3 seconds each.

This plan ensures safe navigation around the obstruction while maintaining the required speed.
