To plan the vehicle¡¯s route while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into phases:

1. **Initial Phase (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds):** Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
2. **Bypass Phase (T = 2 to T = 8 seconds):** Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) to bypass the obstruction at X = 100.
3. **Return Phase (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds):** Transition back to the original lane (Y = 0).

### Assumptions:
- Speed is constant at 72 km/h (20 m/s).
- Lane width (Y-direction) is 5 meters.
- The obstruction is at X = 100 meters.

### Route Plan:

#### 1. Initial Phase (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds):
- **T = 0 seconds:** (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **T = 1 second:** (X, Y) = (20, -2.5) (halfway through lane transition)
- **T = 2 seconds:** (X, Y) = (40, -5) (fully in the adjacent lane)

#### 2. Bypass Phase (T = 2 to T = 8 seconds):
- **T = 3 seconds:** (X, Y) = (60, -5)
- **T = 4 seconds:** (X, Y) = (80, -5)
- **T = 5 seconds:** (X, Y) = (100, -5) (bypassing obstruction)
- **T = 6 seconds:** (X, Y) = (120, -5)
- **T = 7 seconds:** (X, Y) = (140, -5)
- **T = 8 seconds:** (X, Y) = (160, -5)

#### 3. Return Phase (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds):
- **T = 9 seconds:** (X, Y) = (180, -2.5) (halfway back to original lane)
- **T = 10 seconds:** (X, Y) = (200, 0) (fully back in the original lane)

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |
| 2        | 40    | -5    |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -5    |
| 8        | 160   | -5    |
| 9        | 180   | -2.5  |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed of 72 km/h, successfully bypasses the obstruction, and returns to the original lane within 10 seconds.
