To plan the route, we need to calculate the vehicle's position at each second while transitioning lanes, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. Here¡¯s the step-by-step breakdown:

---

### **Given:**
- **Initial position:** \( (X, Y) = (0, 0) \)
- **Obstruction position:** \( (100, 0) \)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate:** \( Y = -5 \)
- **Initial velocity:** \( 72 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \)
- **Minimum speed:** \( 60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \)
- **Time frame:** \( T = 0 \) to \( T = 10 \) seconds

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The lane change takes **2 seconds** (smooth transition).
2. The vehicle bypasses the obstruction in the adjacent lane from \( X = 80 \) to \( X = 120 \).
3. The vehicle returns to the original lane after bypassing the obstruction.

---

### **Step 1: Initial Movement (Straight Line, \( Y = 0 \))**
- From \( T = 0 \) to \( T = 3 \) seconds, the vehicle moves straight in the outer lane.
- Distance traveled per second: \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | 0     |
| 2        | 40    | 0     |
| 3        | 60    | 0     |

---

### **Step 2: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (\( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \))**
- From \( T = 3 \) to \( T = 5 \) seconds, the vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane.
- Lateral movement: \( Y \) changes from \( 0 \) to \( -5 \).
- Longitudinal movement: \( X \) increases at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 4        | 80    | -2.5  |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |

---

### **Step 3: Bypassing the Obstruction in Adjacent Lane**
- From \( T = 5 \) to \( T = 7 \) seconds, the vehicle bypasses the obstruction.
- Longitudinal movement: \( X \) increases at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).
- Lateral position remains \( Y = -5 \).

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -5    |

---

### **Step 4: Lane Change Back to Original Lane (\( Y = -5 \) to \( Y = 0 \))**
- From \( T = 7 \) to \( T = 9 \) seconds, the vehicle transitions back to the original lane.
- Lateral movement: \( Y \) changes from \( -5 \) to \( 0 \).
- Longitudinal movement: \( X \) increases at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 8        | 160   | -2.5  |
| 9        | 180   | 0     |

---

### **Step 5: Continue in Original Lane**
- At \( T = 10 \) seconds, the vehicle continues in the original lane.

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

---

### **Summary of Positions:**
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | 0     |
| 2        | 40    | 0     |
| 3        | 60    | 0     |
| 4        | 80    | -2.5  |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -5    |
| 8        | 160   | -2.5  |
| 9        | 180   | 0     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

---

### **Key Points:**
1. The vehicle maintains a speed of \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \) throughout.
2. The lane changes are smooth and take 2 seconds each.
3. The obstruction is bypassed in the adjacent lane from \( X = 80 \) to \( X = 120 \).
4. The vehicle returns to the original lane after bypassing the obstruction.
