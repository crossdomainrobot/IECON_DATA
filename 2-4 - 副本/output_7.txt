To plan the route and estimate the vehicle's position at critical intervals, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into phases:

1. **Phase 1: Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)**  
   - Move from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
   - Assume a smooth lateral transition over 3 seconds.

2. **Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7 seconds)**  
   - Travel in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) to bypass the obstruction at X = 100.
   - Maintain a speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s).

3. **Phase 3: Lane Return (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds)**  
   - Move back from the adjacent lane (Y = -5) to the outer lane (Y = 0).
   - Assume a smooth lateral transition over 3 seconds.

### Calculations:
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
- Distance traveled per second: 20 meters.

#### Phase 1: Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)
- Lateral movement: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds.
- Y-position: Decreases linearly from 0 to -5.

#### Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7 seconds)
- Lateral position: Y = -5 (constant).
- Forward movement: X increases at 20 m/s.

#### Phase 3: Lane Return (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds)
- Lateral movement: Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.
- Y-position: Increases linearly from -5 to 0.

| Time (T) | X-Position (m) | Y-Position (m) | Description                     |
|----------|----------------|----------------|---------------------------------|
| 0        | 0              | 0              | Starting point.                 |
| 1        | 20             | -1.67          | Transitioning to adjacent lane. |
| 2        | 40             | -3.33          | Transitioning to adjacent lane. |
| 3        | 60             | -5             | Fully in adjacent lane.         |
| 4        | 80             | -5             | Bypassing obstruction.          |
| 5        | 100            | -5             | Reaches obstruction location.   |
| 6        | 120            | -5             | Bypassing obstruction.          |
| 7        | 140            | -5             | Bypassing obstruction.          |
| 8        | 160            | -3.33          | Transitioning back to outer lane.|
| 9        | 180            | -1.67          | Transitioning back to outer lane.|
| 10       | 200            | 0              | Fully back in outer lane.       |

### Key Points:
- The vehicle maintains a speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) throughout.
- The lane transitions are smooth and take 3 seconds each.
- The obstruction at X = 100 is bypassed in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
- The maneuver is completed within 10 seconds.
