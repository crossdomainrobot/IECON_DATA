To construct a route planning for your vehicle, we need to break down the maneuver into key phases: transitioning to the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. We¡¯ll calculate your vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals (T = 0 to T = 10) while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.

### Key Parameters:
- **Initial speed**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s (converted for ease of calculation).
- **Obstruction position**: (100, 0).
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5.
- **Time intervals**: T = 0 to T = 10 seconds.
- **Lane transition time**: Assume 2 seconds to move laterally into the adjacent lane and 2 seconds to return.

### Step 1: Transition to the Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2)
At T = 0, your position is (0, 0). Over 2 seconds, you transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while maintaining a constant speed of 20 m/s along the X-axis.

- **T = 0**: (0, 0)
- **T = 1**: (20, -2.5) (halfway through the lateral transition)
- **T = 2**: (40, -5) (fully in the adjacent lane)

---

### Step 2: Bypass the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)
From T = 2 to T = 6, you continue in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) to bypass the obstruction at X = 100.

- **T = 3**: (60, -5)
- **T = 4**: (80, -5)
- **T = 5**: (100, -5) (bypassing the obstruction)
- **T = 6**: (120, -5)

---

### Step 3: Return to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)
From T = 6 to T = 8, you transition back to the original lane (Y = 0) while maintaining speed.

- **T = 7**: (140, -2.5) (halfway through the lateral transition)
- **T = 8**: (160, 0) (fully back in the original lane)

---

### Step 4: Continue in the Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)
From T = 8 onwards, you continue in the original lane (Y = 0).

- **T = 9**: (180, 0)
- **T = 10**: (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|-----------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |
| 2        | (40, -5)        |
| 3        | (60, -5)        |
| 4        | (80, -5)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -5)       |
| 7        | (140, -2.5)     |
| 8        | (160, 0)        |
| 9        | (180, 0)        |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

### Notes:
- Speed is maintained at 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout, ensuring it exceeds 60 km/h.
- Lateral transitions are smooth and take 2 seconds each.
- The obstruction at X = 100 is safely bypassed by staying in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
