To navigate around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we need to plan the lane transitions carefully. Here's the step-by-step route planning:

---

### **Given:**
- **Starting position (T = 0):** (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Obstruction position:** (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane position:** Y = -5
- **Initial velocity:** 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum speed to maintain:** 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The lane transition takes **2 seconds** to move from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
2. The obstruction bypass occurs between **X = 90** and **X = 110**.
3. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of **20 m/s** throughout.

---

### **Critical Intervals:**
1. **T = 0 to T = 2:** Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 (moving into the adjacent lane).
2. **T = 2 to T = 5:** Drive in the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction.
3. **T = 5 to T = 7:** Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 (returning to the original lane).

### **Position Estimates:**

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) | Description                     |
|----------|-------|-------|---------------------------------|
| T = 0    | 0     | 0     | Start position                  |
| T = 1    | 20    | -2.5  | Transitioning to adjacent lane  |
| T = 2    | 40    | -5    | Fully in adjacent lane          |
| T = 3    | 60    | -5    | Bypassing obstruction           |
| T = 4    | 80    | -5    | Bypassing obstruction           |
| T = 5    | 100   | -5    | Bypassing obstruction           |
| T = 6    | 120   | -2.5  | Transitioning back to original lane |
| T = 7    | 140   | 0     | Fully back in original lane     |
| T = 8    | 160   | 0     | Continuing in original lane     |
| T = 9    | 180   | 0     | Continuing in original lane     |
| T = 10   | 200   | 0     | Continuing in original lane     |

### **Explanation:**
1. **T = 0 to T = 2:** The vehicle moves laterally from Y = 0 to Y = -5 while continuing forward at 20 m/s.
2. **T = 2 to T = 5:** The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) and bypasses the obstruction.
3. **T = 5 to T = 7:** The vehicle transitions back to the original lane (Y = 0) while maintaining forward speed.
4. **T = 7 to T = 10:** The vehicle continues in the original lane (Y = 0).

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h and safely navigates around the obstruction.
