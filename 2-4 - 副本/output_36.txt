To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into phases: **lane transition**, **bypassing the obstruction**, and **returning to the original lane**. We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals, ensuring the speed remains above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s) throughout.

### **Given:**
- **Initial position:** (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Obstruction position:** (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate:** Y = -5
- **Initial velocity:** 72 km/h = 20 m/s
- **Minimum speed:** 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s
- **Time interval:** 1 second

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The lane transition takes **3 seconds** (smooth lateral movement).
2. The bypass phase lasts until the vehicle clears the obstruction (X > 100).
3. The return to the original lane takes **3 seconds**.

### **Phase 1: Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 3)**
- **Lateral movement:** Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds.
- **Lateral velocity:** ¦¤Y = -5 / 3 ¡Ö -1.67 m/s
- **Longitudinal movement:** Maintain speed of 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m)       | Y (m)       |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| T = 0    | 0           | 0           |
| T = 1    | 20          | -1.67       |
| T = 2    | 40          | -3.33       |
| T = 3    | 60          | -5          |

---

### **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 6)**
- **Lateral position:** Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
- **Longitudinal movement:** Continue at 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m)       | Y (m)       |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| T = 4    | 80          | -5          |
| T = 5    | 100         | -5          |
| T = 6    | 120         | -5          |

---

### **Phase 3: Returning to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 9)**
- **Lateral movement:** Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.
- **Lateral velocity:** ¦¤Y = 5 / 3 ¡Ö 1.67 m/s
- **Longitudinal movement:** Maintain speed of 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m)       | Y (m)       |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| T = 7    | 140         | -3.33       |
| T = 8    | 160         | -1.67       |
| T = 9    | 180         | 0           |

---

### **Phase 4: Continuing in the Original Lane (T = 9 to T = 10)**
- **Lateral position:** Stay in the original lane (Y = 0).
- **Longitudinal movement:** Continue at 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m)       | Y (m)       |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| T = 10   | 200         | 0           |

---

### **Summary of Positions:**
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m)  |
|----------|-------|--------|
| T = 0    | 0     | 0      |
| T = 1    | 20    | -1.67  |
| T = 2    | 40    | -3.33  |
| T = 3    | 60    | -5     |
| T = 4    | 80    | -5     |
| T = 5    | 100   | -5     |
| T = 6    | 120   | -5     |
| T = 7    | 140   | -3.33  |
| T = 8    | 160   | -1.67  |
| T = 9    | 180   | 0      |
| T = 10   | 200   | 0      |

### **Key Points:**
1. The vehicle clears the obstruction at T = 5 (X = 100).
2. The speed remains constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h), satisfying the minimum speed requirement.
3. The lane transitions are smooth and completed within 3 seconds each.
