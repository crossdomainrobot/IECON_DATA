To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we need to calculate the vehicle's position at critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. The vehicle starts at (0, 0) with an initial velocity of 72 km/h (20 m/s). The obstruction is at (100, 0), and the adjacent lane is at Y = -5. We need to ensure the vehicle maintains a speed exceeding 60 km/h (16.67 m/s) throughout the maneuver.

### Step-by-Step Route Planning:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - Starting point: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
   - Velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s
   - Obstruction at (100, 0)
   - Adjacent lane at Y = -5

2. **Time Intervals:**
   - We will calculate the position every second (T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10).

3. **Lane Change Strategy:**
   - **First 3 seconds:** Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 (change lanes).
   - **Next 4 seconds:** Travel in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) to bypass the obstruction.
   - **Last 3 seconds:** Transition back to the original lane (Y = 0).

4. **Calculations:**

   - **T = 0s:**
     - Position: (0, 0)
   
   - **T = 1s:**
     - X = 20 * 1 = 20 m
     - Y = 0 + (-5/3 * 1) = -1.67 m (beginning lane change)
     - Position: (20, -1.67)
   
   - **T = 2s:**
     - X = 20 * 2 = 40 m
     - Y = 0 + (-5/3 * 2) = -3.33 m (continuing lane change)
     - Position: (40, -3.33)
   
   - **T = 3s:**
     - X = 20 * 3 = 60 m
     - Y = -5 m (lane change completed)
     - Position: (60, -5)
   
   - **T = 4s:**
     - X = 20 * 4 = 80 m
     - Y = -5 m (traveling in adjacent lane)
     - Position: (80, -5)
   
   - **T = 5s:**
     - X = 20 * 5 = 100 m
     - Y = -5 m (bypassing the obstruction)
     - Position: (100, -5)
   
   - **T = 6s:**
     - X = 20 * 6 = 120 m
     - Y = -5 m (continuing in adjacent lane)
     - Position: (120, -5)
   
   - **T = 7s:**
     - X = 20 * 7 = 140 m
     - Y = -5 + (5/3 * 1) = -3.33 m (beginning lane change back)
     - Position: (140, -3.33)
   
   - **T = 8s:**
     - X = 20 * 8 = 160 m
     - Y = -5 + (5/3 * 2) = -1.67 m (continuing lane change back)
     - Position: (160, -1.67)
   
   - **T = 9s:**
     - X = 20 * 9 = 180 m
     - Y = 0 m (lane change back completed)
     - Position: (180, 0)
   
   - **T = 10s:**
     - X = 20 * 10 = 200 m
     - Y = 0 m (back in original lane)
     - Position: (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions:

- **T = 0s:** (0, 0)
- **T = 1s:** (20, -1.67)
- **T = 2s:** (40, -3.33)
- **T = 3s:** (60, -5)
- **T = 4s:** (80, -5)
- **T = 5s:** (100, -5)
- **T = 6s:** (120, -5)
- **T = 7s:** (140, -3.33)
- **T = 8s:** (160, -1.67)
- **T = 9s:** (180, 0)
- **T = 10s:** (200, 0)

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed exceeding 60 km/h while safely navigating around the obstruction and returning to the original lane.
