To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:  
1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane** (from Y = 0 to Y = -5).  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction** (while maintaining Y = -5).  
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane** (from Y = -5 to Y = 0).  

### Assumptions:  
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).  
- Obstruction is at X = 100 meters.  
- Lane changes take 2 seconds each.  
- Constant speed of 20 m/s is maintained throughout.  

### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)  
- **Lateral Movement**: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.  
- **Longitudinal Movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.  

Positions:  
- T = 0: (0, 0)  
- T = 1: (20, -2.5)  
- T = 2: (40, -5)  

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6 seconds)  
- **Lateral Movement**: Maintain Y = -5.  
- **Longitudinal Movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.  

Positions:  
- T = 3: (60, -5)  
- T = 4: (80, -5)  
- T = 5: (100, -5)  
- T = 6: (120, -5)  

### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)  
- **Lateral Movement**: Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.  
- **Longitudinal Movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.  

Positions:  
- T = 7: (140, -2.5)  
- T = 8: (160, 0)  

### Final Positions (T = 9 to T = 10 seconds)  
- **Lateral Movement**: Maintain Y = 0.  
- **Longitudinal Movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.  

Positions:  
- T = 9: (180, 0)  
- T = 10: (200, 0)  

### Summary of Positions:  
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |  
| 2        | 40    | -5    |  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    |  
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |  
| 8        | 160   | 0     |  
| 9        | 180   | 0     |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |  

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
