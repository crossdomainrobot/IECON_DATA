To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the vehicle's movement into critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. The vehicle starts at (0, 0) with an initial velocity of 72 km/h (20 m/s) and must maintain a speed above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s). The adjacent lane is at Y = -5, and the obstruction is at (100, 0).

### Assumptions:
1. The vehicle transitions smoothly between lanes.
2. The lateral movement (Y-axis) is linear and takes 2 seconds to complete each lane change.
3. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s along the X-axis.

### Critical Intervals:
1. **T = 0 to T = 2 seconds**: Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
2. **T = 2 to T = 8 seconds**: Travel in the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction.
3. **T = 8 to T = 10 seconds**: Transition back to the original lane (Y = 0).

### Position Estimates:
- **T = 0 seconds**: (0, 0)
- **T = 1 second**: (20, -2.5) ！ Midway through the first lane change.
- **T = 2 seconds**: (40, -5) ！ Fully in the adjacent lane.
- **T = 3 seconds**: (60, -5)
- **T = 4 seconds**: (80, -5)
- **T = 5 seconds**: (100, -5) ！ Bypassing the obstruction.
- **T = 6 seconds**: (120, -5)
- **T = 7 seconds**: (140, -5)
- **T = 8 seconds**: (160, -5) ！ Start transitioning back to the original lane.
- **T = 9 seconds**: (180, -2.5) ！ Midway through the second lane change.
- **T = 10 seconds**: (200, 0) ！ Fully back in the original lane.

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|-----------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |
| 2        | (40, -5)        |
| 3        | (60, -5)        |
| 4        | (80, -5)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -5)       |
| 7        | (140, -5)       |
| 8        | (160, -5)       |
| 9        | (180, -2.5)     |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h and smoothly transitions between lanes.
