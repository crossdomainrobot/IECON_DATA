To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):**  
   - Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) smoothly.  
   - Assume this takes **2 seconds**.  

2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100):**  
   - Travel in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until you¡¯ve passed the obstruction at X = 100.  
   - Assume this takes **4 seconds**.  

3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0):**  
   - Transition back to the original lane (Y = 0) smoothly.  
   - Assume this takes **2 seconds**.  

### Vehicle Dynamics:
- **Initial Speed:** 72 km/h = 20 m/s.  
- **Minimum Speed:** 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.  
- Assume constant speed of **20 m/s** for simplicity.  

### Position Estimates:
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at 1-second intervals over 10 seconds.

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)**  
- **Y-coordinate:** Smoothly transitions from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.  
  - At T = 1 second: Y = -2.5 (halfway through the lane change).  
  - At T = 2 seconds: Y = -5 (fully in the adjacent lane).  
- **X-coordinate:** Travels at 20 m/s.  
  - At T = 1 second: X = 20.  
  - At T = 2 seconds: X = 40.  

---

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6 seconds)**  
- **Y-coordinate:** Remains at Y = -5.  
- **X-coordinate:** Travels at 20 m/s.  
  - At T = 3 seconds: X = 60.  
  - At T = 4 seconds: X = 80.  
  - At T = 5 seconds: X = 100.  
  - At T = 6 seconds: X = 120.  

---

#### **Phase 3: Lane Change Back to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)**  
- **Y-coordinate:** Smoothly transitions from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.  
  - At T = 7 seconds: Y = -2.5 (halfway through the lane change).  
  - At T = 8 seconds: Y = 0 (fully in the original lane).  
- **X-coordinate:** Travels at 20 m/s.  
  - At T = 7 seconds: X = 140.  
  - At T = 8 seconds: X = 160.  

---

#### **Continued Travel in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds)**  
- **Y-coordinate:** Remains at Y = 0.  
- **X-coordinate:** Travels at 20 m/s.  
  - At T = 9 seconds: X = 180.  
  - At T = 10 seconds: X = 200.

### Summary of Positions (X, Y) at 1-Second Intervals:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |  
| 2        | 40    | -5    |  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    |  
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |  
| 8        | 160   | 0     |  
| 9        | 180   | 0     |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |  

This plan ensures the vehicle navigates around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h and completes the maneuver within 10 seconds.
