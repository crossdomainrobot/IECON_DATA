To construct the route planning, we¡¯ll break down the maneuver into key steps and calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals. The vehicle must transition to the adjacent lane, bypass the obstruction, and return to the original lane while maintaining a speed exceeding 60 km/h (16.67 m/s). Here¡¯s the plan:

---

### **Assumptions and Calculations**
1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - Starting position: \( (X, Y) = (0, 0) \)
   - Obstruction position: \( (X, Y) = (100, 0) \)
   - Adjacent lane: \( Y = -5 \)
   - Initial speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
   - Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)

2. **Maneuver Steps**:
   - **Step 1**: Transition to the adjacent lane (\( Y = -5 \)) over 2 seconds.
   - **Step 2**: Maintain the adjacent lane while bypassing the obstruction at \( X = 100 \).
   - **Step 3**: Transition back to the original lane (\( Y = 0 \)) over 2 seconds.

3. **Speed**:
   - Maintain a constant speed of 20 m/s throughout the maneuver.

4. **Critical Points**:
   - At \( T = 0 \), the vehicle is at \( (0, 0) \).
   - At \( T = 2 \), the vehicle reaches \( Y = -5 \).
   - At \( T = 5 \), the vehicle bypasses the obstruction at \( X = 100 \).
   - At \( T = 7 \), the vehicle returns to \( Y = 0 \).

### **Position Estimates at 1-Second Intervals**
Using \( X = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \) and interpolating \( Y \) for lane transitions:

| Time (s) | \( X \) (m) | \( Y \) (m) | Description               |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| T = 0    | 0           | 0           | Starting point            |
| T = 1    | 20          | -2.5        | Transitioning to \( Y = -5 \) |
| T = 2    | 40          | -5          | Fully in adjacent lane    |
| T = 3    | 60          | -5          | Bypassing obstruction     |
| T = 4    | 80          | -5          | Bypassing obstruction     |
| T = 5    | 100         | -5          | At obstruction point      |
| T = 6    | 120         | -2.5        | Transitioning to \( Y = 0 \) |
| T = 7    | 140         | 0           | Fully in original lane    |
| T = 8    | 160         | 0           | Continuing in original lane |
| T = 9    | 180         | 0           | Continuing in original lane |
| T = 10   | 200         | 0           | Continuing in original lane |

---

### **Summary**
- The vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane between \( T = 0 \) and \( T = 2 \).
- It maintains the adjacent lane until \( T = 5 \), bypassing the obstruction at \( X = 100 \).
- It transitions back to the original lane between \( T = 5 \) and \( T = 7 \).
- The vehicle continues in the original lane after \( T = 7 \), maintaining a speed of 20 m/s.
