To plan the route for the vehicle to bypass the obstruction, we need to calculate the vehicle's position at critical time intervals while transitioning to the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. Here's the step-by-step process:

---

### **Given:**
- Starting position: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- Obstruction position: (100, 0)
- Adjacent lane Y-coordinate: Y = -5
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- Time interval: 10 seconds

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s.
2. Lane transitions are smooth and take 2 seconds each.
3. The vehicle stays in the adjacent lane for 6 seconds to bypass the obstruction.

---

### **Route Plan:**

#### **Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds):**
- The vehicle moves from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.
- Lateral velocity: \( \frac{-5 \, \text{m}}{2 \, \text{s}} = -2.5 \, \text{m/s} \)
- Positions:
  - T = 0: (0, 0)
  - T = 1: (20, -2.5)
  - T = 2: (40, -5)

#### **Bypassing Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 8 seconds):**
- The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) for 6 seconds.
- Positions:
  - T = 3: (60, -5)
  - T = 4: (80, -5)
  - T = 5: (100, -5)
  - T = 6: (120, -5)
  - T = 7: (140, -5)
  - T = 8: (160, -5)

#### **Returning to Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds):**
- The vehicle moves from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.
- Lateral velocity: \( \frac{5 \, \text{m}}{2 \, \text{s}} = 2.5 \, \text{m/s} \)
- Positions:
  - T = 9: (180, -2.5)
  - T = 10: (200, 0)

### **Summary of Positions:**
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |
| 2        | 40    | -5    |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -5    |
| 8        | 160   | -5    |
| 9        | 180   | -2.5  |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### **Explanation:**
1. The vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane in 2 seconds, reaching Y = -5 at T = 2.
2. It remains in the adjacent lane for 6 seconds to bypass the obstruction at X = 100.
3. It transitions back to the original lane in the final 2 seconds, returning to Y = 0 at T = 10.

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) and successfully bypasses the obstruction.
