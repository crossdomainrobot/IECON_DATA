To construct a route planning for this scenario, we¡¯ll break down the vehicle¡¯s motion into critical intervals of 1 second each. We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at each time step, ensuring the speed remains above 60 km/h and the lane transitions are smooth.

### Given:
- **Initial position**: (0, 0)
- **Obstruction position**: (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5
- **Initial velocity**: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- **Time intervals**: T = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10 seconds

### Assumptions:
1. The vehicle accelerates/decelerates uniformly during lane transitions.
2. The lane transition (Y-axis movement) is completed over 3 seconds.
3. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s during straight-line travel.

### Plan:
1. **Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**:
   - Start at T = 0, (0, 0)
   - Transition to Y = -5 over 3 seconds (T = 0 to T = 3)
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction**:
   - Continue in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until X > 100
3. **Lane Change Back to Original Lane (Y = 0)**:
   - Transition back to Y = 0 over 3 seconds after bypassing the obstruction

### Calculations:
#### 1. Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 3):
- **Y-axis motion**: Move from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds
  - Y-position at T = 1: Y = -5/3 ¡Ö -1.67
  - Y-position at T = 2: Y = -10/3 ¡Ö -3.33
  - Y-position at T = 3: Y = -5
- **X-axis motion**: Constant speed of 20 m/s
  - X-position at T = 1: 20 m
  - X-position at T = 2: 40 m
  - X-position at T = 3: 60 m

#### 2. Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7):
- **Y-axis motion**: Stay at Y = -5
- **X-axis motion**: Constant speed of 20 m/s
  - X-position at T = 4: 80 m
  - X-position at T = 5: 100 m
  - X-position at T = 6: 120 m
  - X-position at T = 7: 140 m

#### 3. Lane Change Back to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10):
- **Y-axis motion**: Move from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds
  - Y-position at T = 8: Y = -5 + 5/3 ¡Ö -3.33
  - Y-position at T = 9: Y = -5 + 10/3 ¡Ö -1.67
  - Y-position at T = 10: Y = 0
- **X-axis motion**: Constant speed of 20 m/s
  - X-position at T = 8: 160 m
  - X-position at T = 9: 180 m
  - X-position at T = 10: 200 m

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -1.67 |
| 2        | 40    | -3.33 |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -5    |
| 8        | 160   | -3.33 |
| 9        | 180   | -1.67 |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### Notes:
- The vehicle successfully bypasses the obstruction at X = 100 while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
- Lane transitions are smooth and completed within the specified time intervals.
