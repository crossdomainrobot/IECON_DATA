To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the problem into three phases:

1. **Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypass the obstruction at X = 100**  
3. **Return to the original lane (Y = 0)**

### Assumptions:
- Initial velocity: \( 72 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- Minimum speed: \( 60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- Obstruction at \( X = 100 \, \text{m} \)  
- Adjacent lane at \( Y = -5 \, \text{m} \)  
- Time step: \( 1 \, \text{second} \)  

### Phase 1: Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5)
Assume the lane change takes **2 seconds**. During this time, the vehicle moves laterally from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \). The lateral velocity is \( \frac{-5 \, \text{m}}{2 \, \text{s}} = -2.5 \, \text{m/s} \).

#### Positions:
- \( T = 0 \, \text{s}: (0, 0) \)  
- \( T = 1 \, \text{s}: (20, -2.5) \)  
- \( T = 2 \, \text{s}: (40, -5) \)  

### Phase 2: Bypass the obstruction (X = 100)
After transitioning to the adjacent lane, the vehicle continues at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \) to bypass the obstruction. The obstruction is at \( X = 100 \, \text{m} \), so the vehicle will pass it at \( T = 5 \, \text{s} \).

#### Positions:
- \( T = 3 \, \text{s}: (60, -5) \)  
- \( T = 4 \, \text{s}: (80, -5) \)  
- \( T = 5 \, \text{s}: (100, -5) \)  

### Phase 3: Return to the original lane (Y = 0)
Assume the lane change back to \( Y = 0 \) takes **2 seconds**, starting at \( T = 6 \, \text{s} \). The lateral velocity is \( \frac{5 \, \text{m}}{2 \, \text{s}} = 2.5 \, \text{m/s} \).

#### Positions:
- \( T = 6 \, \text{s}: (120, -5) \)  
- \( T = 7 \, \text{s}: (140, -2.5) \)  
- \( T = 8 \, \text{s}: (160, 0) \)  

### Final Positions:
- \( T = 9 \, \text{s}: (180, 0) \)  
- \( T = 10 \, \text{s}: (200, 0) \)  

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| 0        | (0, 0)          |  
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |  
| 2        | (40, -5)        |  
| 3        | (60, -5)        |  
| 4        | (80, -5)        |  
| 5        | (100, -5)       |  
| 6        | (120, -5)       |  
| 7        | (140, -2.5)     |  
| 8        | (160, 0)        |  
| 9        | (180, 0)        |  
| 10       | (200, 0)        |  

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above \( 60 \, \text{km/h} \) and successfully bypasses the obstruction.
