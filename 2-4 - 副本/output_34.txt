To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break the process into key intervals and calculate the vehicle's position (X, Y) at each second over the next 10 seconds. The goal is to transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5), bypass the obstruction at X = 100, and return to the original lane (Y = 0) while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.

### Assumptions:
1. **Initial Speed:** 72 km/h = 20 m/s (converted for ease of calculation).
2. **Lane Width:** Transitioning to the adjacent lane requires moving laterally by Y = -5 (assuming lanes are 5 meters wide).
3. **Obstruction Location:** At X = 100 meters.
4. **Time Intervals:** 1-second intervals for 10 seconds.

### Route Plan:
1. **T = 0 to T = 2 seconds:** Begin transitioning to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
2. **T = 2 to T = 8 seconds:** Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) to bypass the obstruction.
3. **T = 8 to T = 10 seconds:** Return to the original lane (Y = 0).

### Calculations:
- **Lateral Movement:** Assume it takes 2 seconds to move to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) and 2 seconds to return to the original lane (Y = 0).
- **Longitudinal Movement:** At 20 m/s, the vehicle travels 20 meters per second along the X-axis.

### Position Estimates:
| Time (T) | X Position (m) | Y Position (m) | Description                     |
|----------|----------------|----------------|---------------------------------|
| 0        | 0              | 0              | Starting point                  |
| 1        | 20             | -2.5           | Transitioning to adjacent lane  |
| 2        | 40             | -5             | Fully in adjacent lane          |
| 3        | 60             | -5             | Bypassing obstruction           |
| 4        | 80             | -5             | Bypassing obstruction           |
| 5        | 100            | -5             | At obstruction location         |
| 6        | 120            | -5             | Past obstruction                |
| 7        | 140            | -5             | Past obstruction                |
| 8        | 160            | -2.5           | Transitioning to original lane  |
| 9        | 180            | 0              | Fully in original lane          |
| 10       | 200            | 0              | Continuing in original lane     |

### Explanation:
1. **T = 0 to T = 2:** The vehicle moves laterally from Y = 0 to Y = -5 while maintaining a speed of 20 m/s along the X-axis.
2. **T = 2 to T = 8:** The vehicle stays in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) to bypass the obstruction at X = 100.
3. **T = 8 to T = 10:** The vehicle transitions back to the original lane (Y = 0) while continuing to move forward.

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h (20 m/s) throughout the maneuver.
