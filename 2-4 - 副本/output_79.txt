### Understanding the Problem

First, let's break down the scenario:

- **Road Layout**: Two parallel lanes. I'm currently in the outer lane, which we'll consider as the starting position (0,0).
- **Obstruction**: There's an unexpected blockage directly ahead at (100,0).
- **Objective**: Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5), bypass the obstruction, and return to the original lane.
- **Constraints**:
  - Initial velocity: 72 km/h.
  - Must maintain a speed above 60 km/h throughout the maneuver.
  - Time frame: Next 10 seconds.

### Converting Speed to Meters per Second

To make calculations easier, I'll convert the speed from km/h to m/s.

- **Initial Speed**: 72 km/h
  - Conversion: \( 72 \times \frac{1000 \text{ meters}}{3600 \text{ seconds}} = 20 \text{ m/s} \)
- **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h
  - Conversion: \( 60 \times \frac{1000}{3600} \approx 16.67 \text{ m/s} \)

### Planning the Lane Transition

I need to move from the outer lane (Y=0) to the adjacent lane (Y=-5), bypass the obstruction at X=100, and then return to the original lane. Here's how I'll approach it:

1. **Lane Change to Adjacent Lane**:
   - Start at (0,0).
   - Move to (X, -5) over a certain distance.

2. **Bypassing the Obstruction**:
   - Continue in the adjacent lane until I've passed X=100.

3. **Returning to Original Lane**:
   - Move back to (X, 0) from (X, -5).

### Estimating Positions Over Time

Assuming constant speed and smooth lane changes, I'll estimate the vehicle's position every second for the next 10 seconds.

#### Step 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (Y=0 to Y=-5)

Let's assume the lane change takes 2 seconds.

- **At T=0s**: Position = (0, 0)
- **At T=1s**: Position = (20, -2.5) [Halfway through the lane change]
- **At T=2s**: Position = (40, -5) [Fully in the adjacent lane]

#### Step 2: Bypassing the Obstruction

Continue moving in the adjacent lane at 20 m/s.

- **At T=3s**: Position = (60, -5)
- **At T=4s**: Position = (80, -5)
- **At T=5s**: Position = (100, -5) [Reached the obstruction point]

Since the obstruction is at X=100, I need to ensure I'm in the adjacent lane at this point.

#### Step 3: Returning to Original Lane (Y=-5 to Y=0)

Assume the return lane change also takes 2 seconds.

- **At T=6s**: Position = (120, -2.5) [Starting to return]
- **At T=7s**: Position = (140, 0) [Fully back in the original lane]

#### Step 4: Continuing in the Original Lane

- **At T=8s**: Position = (160, 0)
- **At T=9s**: Position = (180, 0)
- **At T=10s**: Position = (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions Over 10 Seconds

| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|-----------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |
| 2        | (40, -5)        |
| 3        | (60, -5)        |
| 4        | (80, -5)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -2.5)     |
| 7        | (140, 0)        |
| 8        | (160, 0)        |
| 9        | (180, 0)        |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

### Verifying Speed Constraints

Throughout the maneuver, the speed is maintained at 20 m/s (72 km/h), which is above the minimum required speed of 16.67 m/s (60 km/h). Therefore, the plan adheres to the speed constraints.

### Final Answer

Based on the calculations and assumptions, here's the estimated position of the vehicle every second over the next 10 seconds:

| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|-----------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |
| 2        | (40, -5)        |
| 3        | (60, -5)        |
| 4        | (80, -5)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -2.5)     |
| 7        | (140, 0)        |
| 8        | (160, 0)        |
| 9        | (180, 0)        |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

This route planning ensures that the vehicle successfully navigates around the obstruction while maintaining the required speed.
