### Understanding the Problem

First, let's break down the scenario:

- **Road Layout**: Two parallel lanes. I'm currently in the outer lane, which we'll consider as the starting position (0,0).
- **Obstruction**: There's an unexpected blockage directly ahead at (100,0).
- **Objective**: Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5), bypass the obstruction, and return to the original lane.
- **Constraints**:
  - Initial velocity: 72 km/h.
  - Must maintain a speed above 60 km/h throughout the maneuver.
  - Time starts at T = 0, and we need to plan the route over the next 10 seconds.

### Converting Speed to Meters per Second

To make calculations easier, I'll convert the speed from km/h to m/s.

- **Initial Speed**: 72 km/h
  - Conversion: \( 72 \times \frac{1000 \text{ meters}}{3600 \text{ seconds}} = 20 \text{ m/s} \)
- **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h
  - Conversion: \( 60 \times \frac{1000}{3600} \approx 16.67 \text{ m/s} \)

### Planning the Lane Transition

The goal is to move from the outer lane (Y=0) to the adjacent lane (Y=-5), bypass the obstruction at X=100, and then return to the original lane. Here's how I plan to approach it:

1. **Accelerate/Decelerate**: Ensure speed remains above 16.67 m/s.
2. **Lane Change Timing**: Determine when to start and end the lane change to avoid the obstruction.
3. **Position Estimation**: Calculate the vehicle's position at each second.

### Estimating Positions Over Time

Let's assume the lane change takes a certain amount of time. For simplicity, I'll assume it takes 2 seconds to change lanes in each direction (to and from the adjacent lane).

#### Time Intervals and Positions

We'll track the vehicle's position every second from T=0 to T=10.

1. **T=0s**:
   - **Position**: (0, 0)
   - **Action**: Start in the outer lane.

2. **T=1s**:
   - **Distance Traveled**: \( 20 \text{ m/s} \times 1 \text{ s} = 20 \text{ m} \)
   - **Position**: (20, 0)
   - **Action**: Continue in the outer lane.

3. **T=2s**:
   - **Distance Traveled**: \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ m} \)
   - **Position**: (40, 0)
   - **Action**: Begin lane change to the adjacent lane.

4. **T=3s**:
   - **Distance Traveled**: \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ m} \)
   - **Lateral Movement**: Transitioning to Y=-5 over 2 seconds, so at T=3s, Y=-2.5
   - **Position**: (60, -2.5)
   - **Action**: Midway through lane change.

5. **T=4s**:
   - **Distance Traveled**: \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \text{ m} \)
   - **Lateral Movement**: Fully in the adjacent lane, Y=-5
   - **Position**: (80, -5)
   - **Action**: Now in the adjacent lane, approaching the obstruction.

6. **T=5s**:
   - **Distance Traveled**: \( 20 \times 5 = 100 \text{ m} \)
   - **Position**: (100, -5)
   - **Action**: Bypassing the obstruction in the adjacent lane.

7. **T=6s**:
   - **Distance Traveled**: \( 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ m} \)
   - **Position**: (120, -5)
   - **Action**: Continue in the adjacent lane past the obstruction.

8. **T=7s**:
   - **Distance Traveled**: \( 20 \times 7 = 140 \text{ m} \)
   - **Lateral Movement**: Begin returning to the original lane.
   - **Position**: (140, -2.5)
   - **Action**: Midway through returning to the outer lane.

9. **T=8s**:
   - **Distance Traveled**: \( 20 \times 8 = 160 \text{ m} \)
   - **Lateral Movement**: Fully back in the outer lane, Y=0
   - **Position**: (160, 0)
   - **Action**: Now in the original lane, having bypassed the obstruction.

10. **T=9s**:
    - **Distance Traveled**: \( 20 \times 9 = 180 \text{ m} \)
    - **Position**: (180, 0)
    - **Action**: Continue in the outer lane.

11. **T=10s**:
    - **Distance Traveled**: \( 20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ m} \)
    - **Position**: (200, 0)
    - **Action**: Continue in the outer lane.

### Verifying Speed Constraints

Throughout the maneuver, the speed remains at 20 m/s (72 km/h), which is above the minimum required speed of 16.67 m/s (60 km/h). Therefore, the speed constraint is satisfied.

### Summary of Positions

Here's a summary of the vehicle's position at each second:

| Time (s) | X Position (m) | Y Position (m) | Action |
|----------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| 0        | 0              | 0              | Start in outer lane |
| 1        | 20             | 0              | Continue in outer lane |
| 2        | 40             | 0              | Begin lane change |
| 3        | 60             | -2.5           | Midway to adjacent lane |
| 4        | 80             | -5             | Fully in adjacent lane |
| 5        | 100            | -5             | Bypassing obstruction |
| 6        | 120            | -5             | Continue in adjacent lane |
| 7        | 140            | -2.5           | Begin returning to outer lane |
| 8        | 160            | 0              | Fully back in outer lane |
| 9        | 180            | 0              | Continue in outer lane |
| 10       | 200            | 0              | Continue in outer lane |

### Visual Representation

To better understand the maneuver, here's a simple visual representation:

```
Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) | Action
------------------------------------
0        | 0     | 0     | Start
1        | 20    | 0     | Moving forward
2        | 40    | 0     | Start lane change
3        | 60    | -2.5  | Midway to adjacent lane
4        | 80    | -5    | In adjacent lane
5        | 100   | -5    | Bypassing obstruction
6        | 120   | -5    | Continue in adjacent lane
7        | 140   | -2.5  | Start returning
8        | 160   | 0     | Back in outer lane
9        | 180   | 0     | Moving forward
10       | 200   | 0     | Moving forward
```

### Conclusion

By planning the lane changes and maintaining a consistent speed above the minimum requirement, the vehicle successfully navigates around the obstruction and returns to the original lane within the 10-second timeframe. This approach ensures both safety and efficiency in maneuvering around unexpected roadblocks.
