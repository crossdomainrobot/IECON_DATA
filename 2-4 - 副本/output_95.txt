To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll break the process into three phases:

1. **Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypass the obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Return to the original lane (Y = 0)**  

### Assumptions:
- Initial speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s)  
- Speed must exceed 60 km/h (16.67 m/s) throughout.  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).  
- Obstruction is at X = 100 meters.  
- Time step: 1 second (T = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10).  

### Plan:
1. **Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 3):**  
   - Start at (0, 0).  
   - Transition to Y = -5 over 3 seconds.  
   - Maintain speed of 20 m/s.  

2. **Bypass Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7):**  
   - Continue in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until X > 100.  
   - Maintain speed of 20 m/s.  

3. **Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10):**  
   - Transition back to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.  
   - Maintain speed of 20 m/s.  

### Position Estimates:
- **T = 0:** (0, 0)  
- **T = 1:** (20, -1.67)  
- **T = 2:** (40, -3.33)  
- **T = 3:** (60, -5)  
- **T = 4:** (80, -5)  
- **T = 5:** (100, -5)  
- **T = 6:** (120, -5)  
- **T = 7:** (140, -3.33)  
- **T = 8:** (160, -1.67)  
- **T = 9:** (180, 0)  
- **T = 10:** (200, 0)  

### Explanation:
1. **Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 3):**  
   - Move laterally from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds.  
   - Lateral speed: \( \frac{5 \text{ m}}{3 \text{ s}} \approx 1.67 \text{ m/s} \).  
   - X increases at 20 m/s: \( X = 20 \times T \).  

2. **Bypass Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7):**  
   - Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until X > 100.  
   - X increases at 20 m/s: \( X = 60 + 20 \times (T - 3) \).  

3. **Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10):**  
   - Move laterally from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.  
   - Lateral speed: \( \frac{5 \text{ m}}{3 \text{ s}} \approx 1.67 \text{ m/s} \).  
   - X increases at 20 m/s: \( X = 140 + 20 \times (T - 7) \).  

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
