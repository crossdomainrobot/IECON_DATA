To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):**  
   Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100):**  
   Travel in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until the obstruction is cleared.  
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0):**  
   Transition back to the outer lane (Y = 0).  

### Assumptions:
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h (20 m/s).  
- Speed must exceed 60 km/h (16.67 m/s) throughout.  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).  
- Obstruction is at X = 100 meters.  
- Lane changes take approximately 2 seconds each.  

### Calculations:
1. **Time to Reach the Obstruction:**  
   Distance to obstruction: 100 meters.  
   Time = Distance / Velocity = 100 / 20 = 5 seconds.  

2. **Lane Change Timing:**  
   Start lane change at T = 1 second to ensure the obstruction is bypassed.  
   Complete lane change by T = 3 seconds.  
   Return to the original lane starting at T = 6 seconds, completing by T = 8 seconds.  

3. **Position Estimates:**  
   - **T = 0 seconds:** (0, 0)  
   - **T = 1 second:** (20, 0)  
   - **T = 2 seconds:** (40, -2.5) (midway during lane change)  
   - **T = 3 seconds:** (60, -5) (fully in adjacent lane)  
   - **T = 4 seconds:** (80, -5)  
   - **T = 5 seconds:** (100, -5) (bypassing obstruction)  
   - **T = 6 seconds:** (120, -5)  
   - **T = 7 seconds:** (140, -2.5) (midway during lane change back)  
   - **T = 8 seconds:** (160, 0) (fully back in original lane)  
   - **T = 9 seconds:** (180, 0)  
   - **T = 10 seconds:** (200, 0)  

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| 0        | (0, 0)          |  
| 1        | (20, 0)         |  
| 2        | (40, -2.5)      |  
| 3        | (60, -5)        |  
| 4        | (80, -5)        |  
| 5        | (100, -5)       |  
| 6        | (120, -5)       |  
| 7        | (140, -2.5)     |  
| 8        | (160, 0)        |  
| 9        | (180, 0)        |  
| 10       | (200, 0)        |  

This plan ensures the obstruction is bypassed while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
