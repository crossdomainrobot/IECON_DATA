To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the vehicle's movement into key phases: transitioning to the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. We'll calculate the vehicle's position at 1-second intervals over the next 10 seconds, ensuring the speed remains above 60 km/h.

### Key Assumptions:
1. **Initial Position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
2. **Obstruction Position**: (X, Y) = (100, 0)
3. **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5
4. **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s
5. **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s
6. **Time Intervals**: 1 second (T = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10)

### Route Planning:
1. **Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 3)**:
   - Move from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds.
   - Lateral velocity: \( \frac{-5}{3} \approx -1.67 \, \text{m/s} \)
   - Forward velocity: Maintain 20 m/s.

2. **Bypassing Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7)**:
   - Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while bypassing the obstruction at X = 100.
   - Forward velocity: Maintain 20 m/s.

3. **Returning to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10)**:
   - Move from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.
   - Lateral velocity: \( \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67 \, \text{m/s} \)
   - Forward velocity: Maintain 20 m/s.

### Position Estimates:
- **T = 0**: (0, 0)
- **T = 1**: (20, -1.67)
- **T = 2**: (40, -3.33)
- **T = 3**: (60, -5)
- **T = 4**: (80, -5)
- **T = 5**: (100, -5)
- **T = 6**: (120, -5)
- **T = 7**: (140, -5)
- **T = 8**: (160, -3.33)
- **T = 9**: (180, -1.67)
- **T = 10**: (200, 0)

### Summary:
- The vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane by T = 3, bypasses the obstruction by T = 5, and returns to the original lane by T = 10.
- The speed remains above 60 km/h throughout the maneuver.
- The final position at T = 10 is (200, 0), indicating the vehicle has successfully navigated around the obstruction.
