To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases: **lane change to the adjacent lane**, **bypassing the obstruction**, and **returning to the original lane**. We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals, ensuring the speed remains above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s) throughout.

---

### **Assumptions**
1. **Initial conditions**:
   - Starting position: (0, 0)
   - Initial velocity: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
   - Obstruction at: (100, 0)
   - Adjacent lane: Y = -5

2. **Lane change**:
   - Assume a smooth lateral transition requiring 3 seconds to move from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
   - Linear lateral velocity: \( \frac{-5 \, \text{m}}{3 \, \text{s}} = -1.67 \, \text{m/s} \)

3. **Bypassing the obstruction**:
   - Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing X = 100.

4. **Returning to the original lane**:
   - Assume another 3-second transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 after bypassing the obstruction.

5. **Speed**:
   - Maintain a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout.

### **Route Plan**
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at 1-second intervals for 10 seconds.

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 3)**
- **Lateral movement**: Y decreases linearly from 0 to -5 over 3 seconds.
- **Forward movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m)          | Y (m)          |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| T = 0    | 0              | 0              |
| T = 1    | 20             | -1.67          |
| T = 2    | 40             | -3.33          |
| T = 3    | 60             | -5             |

---

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 6)**
- **Lateral movement**: Y remains constant at -5.
- **Forward movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m)          | Y (m)          |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| T = 4    | 80             | -5             |
| T = 5    | 100            | -5             |
| T = 6    | 120            | -5             |

---

#### **Phase 3: Returning to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 9)**
- **Lateral movement**: Y increases linearly from -5 to 0 over 3 seconds.
- **Forward movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m)          | Y (m)          |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| T = 7    | 140            | -3.33          |
| T = 8    | 160            | -1.67          |
| T = 9    | 180            | 0              |

---

#### **Phase 4: Continuing in the Original Lane (T = 9 to T = 10)**
- **Lateral movement**: Y remains constant at 0.
- **Forward movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m)          | Y (m)          |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| T = 10   | 200            | 0              |

---

### **Summary of Positions**

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m)  |
|----------|-------|--------|
| T = 0    | 0     | 0      |
| T = 1    | 20    | -1.67  |
| T = 2    | 40    | -3.33  |
| T = 3    | 60    | -5     |
| T = 4    | 80    | -5     |
| T = 5    | 100   | -5     |
| T = 6    | 120   | -5     |
| T = 7    | 140   | -3.33  |
| T = 8    | 160   | -1.67  |
| T = 9    | 180   | 0      |
| T = 10   | 200   | 0      |

### **Key Points**
1. The lane change is completed by T = 3, and the vehicle is in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) when it reaches the obstruction at X = 100 (T = 5).
2. The vehicle returns to the original lane by T = 9.
3. The speed remains constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
