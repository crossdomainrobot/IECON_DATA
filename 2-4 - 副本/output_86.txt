To plan the route and estimate the vehicle¡¯s position at critical intervals, we¡¯ll break down the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Returning to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**

### Key Parameters:
- **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s  
- **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s  
- **Obstruction Location**: (100, 0)  
- **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5  
- **Time Horizon**: 10 seconds  

### Assumptions:
- The lane change takes **2 seconds** (a safe and smooth maneuver).  
- The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s throughout.  
- The obstruction is bypassed by staying in the adjacent lane until X > 100.  

### Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)
- **Lateral Movement**: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 linearly over 2 seconds.  
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Continue moving forward at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |
| 2        | 40    | -5    |

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 5 seconds)
- **Lateral Movement**: Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Continue moving forward at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |

### Phase 3: Returning to the Original Lane (T = 5 to T = 7 seconds)
- **Lateral Movement**: Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 linearly over 2 seconds.  
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Continue moving forward at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 6        | 120   | -2.5  |
| 7        | 140   | 0     |

### Phase 4: Continuing in the Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds)
- **Lateral Movement**: Stay in the original lane (Y = 0).  
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Continue moving forward at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 8        | 160   | 0     |
| 9        | 180   | 0     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### Summary of Critical Positions:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) | Phase Description               |
|----------|-------|-------|--------------------------------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     | Start                           |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  | Lane Change                     |
| 2        | 40    | -5    | Lane Change Complete            |
| 3        | 60    | -5    | Bypassing Obstruction           |
| 4        | 80    | -5    | Bypassing Obstruction           |
| 5        | 100   | -5    | Obstruction Bypassed            |
| 6        | 120   | -2.5  | Returning to Original Lane      |
| 7        | 140   | 0     | Return to Original Lane Complete|
| 8        | 160   | 0     | Continuing in Original Lane     |
| 9        | 180   | 0     | Continuing in Original Lane     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     | Continuing in Original Lane     |

This plan ensures the vehicle safely navigates around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
