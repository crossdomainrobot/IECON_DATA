To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:  
1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane** (from Y = 0 to Y = -5).  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction** (while maintaining Y = -5).  
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane** (from Y = -5 to Y = 0).  

### Assumptions:  
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.  
- Obstruction is at X = 100 m.  
- Lane width: 5 m (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).  
- Lane change duration: 3 seconds (smooth transition).  
- Bypassing duration: 4 seconds (to ensure safe clearance).  
- Total maneuver time: 10 seconds.  

### Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)  
- **Lateral movement**: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds.  
- **Longitudinal movement**: Maintain speed at 20 m/s.  

Positions:  
- T = 1 s: X = 20 m, Y = -1.67 m.  
- T = 2 s: X = 40 m, Y = -3.33 m.  
- T = 3 s: X = 60 m, Y = -5 m.  

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7 seconds)  
- **Lateral movement**: Maintain Y = -5 m.  
- **Longitudinal movement**: Continue at 20 m/s.  

Positions:  
- T = 4 s: X = 80 m, Y = -5 m.  
- T = 5 s: X = 100 m, Y = -5 m.  
- T = 6 s: X = 120 m, Y = -5 m.  
- T = 7 s: X = 140 m, Y = -5 m.  

### Phase 3: Lane Change Back (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds)  
- **Lateral movement**: Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.  
- **Longitudinal movement**: Maintain speed at 20 m/s.  

Positions:  
- T = 8 s: X = 160 m, Y = -3.33 m.  
- T = 9 s: X = 180 m, Y = -1.67 m.  
- T = 10 s: X = 200 m, Y = 0 m.  

### Summary of Positions:  
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -1.67 |  
| 2        | 40    | -3.33 |  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    |  
| 7        | 140   | -5    |  
| 8        | 160   | -3.33 |  
| 9        | 180   | -1.67 |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |  

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h and completes the maneuver within 10 seconds.
