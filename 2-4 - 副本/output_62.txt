To construct a route planning for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed exceeding 60 km/h, we need to break down the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane**: Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction**: Continue in the adjacent lane until the obstruction (X = 100) is bypassed.
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane**: Transition from the adjacent lane (Y = -5) back to the outer lane (Y = 0).

### Assumptions:
- **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h (20 m/s).
- **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).
- **Lane Width**: 5 meters (since Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).
- **Time for Lane Change**: Assume 3 seconds for each lane change.
- **Obstruction Position**: X = 100 meters, Y = 0.

### Route Planning:

#### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)
- **Time Interval**: 3 seconds.
- **Lateral Movement**: From Y = 0 to Y = -5.
- **Lateral Velocity**: \( \frac{5 \text{ meters}}{3 \text{ seconds}} \approx 1.67 \text{ m/s} \).

#### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7 seconds)
- **Time Interval**: 4 seconds.
- **Lateral Position**: Y = -5 (adjacent lane).
- **Longitudinal Movement**: From X = 60 meters to X = 140 meters (bypassing the obstruction at X = 100).

#### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds)
- **Time Interval**: 3 seconds.
- **Lateral Movement**: From Y = -5 to Y = 0.
- **Lateral Velocity**: \( \frac{5 \text{ meters}}{3 \text{ seconds}} \approx 1.67 \text{ m/s} \).

### Vehicle Positions at Critical Intervals:

| Time (s) | X (meters) | Y (meters) | Description                               |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 0        | 0          | 0          | Starting point in the outer lane.         |
| 1        | 20         | -1.67      | Midway through lane change.               |
| 2        | 40         | -3.33      | Approaching adjacent lane.                |
| 3        | 60         | -5         | Fully in the adjacent lane.               |
| 4        | 80         | -5         | Bypassing the obstruction.                |
| 5        | 100        | -5         | At the obstruction point (X = 100).       |
| 6        | 120        | -5         | Past the obstruction.                     |
| 7        | 140        | -5         | Preparing to change back to outer lane.   |
| 8        | 160        | -3.33      | Midway through lane change back.          |
| 9        | 180        | -1.67      | Approaching outer lane.                   |
| 10       | 200        | 0          | Fully back in the outer lane.             |

### Notes:
- The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
- The lane changes are smooth and take 3 seconds each.
- The obstruction is bypassed safely by staying in the adjacent lane from X = 60 to X = 140 meters.

This plan ensures that the vehicle navigates around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
