To construct a route planning for navigating around the obstruction, we need to calculate the vehicle's position at critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. Here¡¯s a step-by-step breakdown:

---

### **Given:**
- **Initial Position:** (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Obstruction Position:** (100, 0)
- **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate:** Y = -5
- **Initial Velocity:** 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum Speed:** 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- **Time Interval:** 10 seconds

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle transitions smoothly to the adjacent lane within 2 seconds.
2. The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane while bypassing the obstruction.
3. The vehicle transitions back to the original lane within 2 seconds.
4. The speed remains constant at 72 km/h (20 m/s) throughout.

### **Calculations:**

#### **1. Initial Movement (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds): Transition to Adjacent Lane**
- **Lateral Movement:** From Y = 0 to Y = -5 (linear transition over 2 seconds).
- **Longitudinal Movement:** X = 20 m/s ¡Á T

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |
| 2        | 40    | -5    |

#### **2. Bypassing Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6 seconds): Stay in Adjacent Lane**
- **Lateral Movement:** Y remains at -5.
- **Longitudinal Movement:** X = 40 + 20 m/s ¡Á (T - 2)

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |

#### **3. Transition Back to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds): Return to Y = 0**
- **Lateral Movement:** From Y = -5 to Y = 0 (linear transition over 2 seconds).
- **Longitudinal Movement:** X = 120 + 20 m/s ¡Á (T - 6)

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |
| 8        | 160   | 0     |

#### **4. Continue in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds):**
- **Lateral Movement:** Y remains at 0.
- **Longitudinal Movement:** X = 160 + 20 m/s ¡Á (T - 8)

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 9        | 180   | 0     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

---

### **Final Route Planning:**
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |
| 2        | 40    | -5    |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |
| 8        | 160   | 0     |
| 9        | 180   | 0     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### **Summary:**
- The vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane by T = 2 seconds.
- It bypasses the obstruction while staying in the adjacent lane until T = 6 seconds.
- It transitions back to the original lane by T = 8 seconds.
- It continues in the original lane at the same speed until T = 10 seconds.
