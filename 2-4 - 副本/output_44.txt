To plan the route for your vehicle to bypass the obstruction, we'll break down the maneuver into critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. Here's the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Key Assumptions**
1. **Initial Position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
2. **Obstruction Position**: (100, 0)
3. **Adjacent Lane Position**: Y = -5
4. **Initial Speed**: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
5. **Minimum Speed**: Must exceed 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
6. **Time Intervals**: 1-second increments from T = 0 to T = 10

---

### **Route Plan**
The maneuver involves:
1. **Lane Change to Adjacent Lane**: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
2. **Bypass Obstruction**: Maintain Y = -5 while passing X = 100.
3. **Return to Original Lane**: Transition from Y = -5 back to Y = 0.

We assume the lane change takes **3 seconds** each (to and from the adjacent lane) and the bypass takes **4 seconds**.

### **Position Estimates**
#### **1. Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 3)**
- **Lateral Movement**: Linear transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Constant speed of 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m) = 20 * T | Y (m) = -5/3 * T |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| T = 0    | 0              | 0                |
| T = 1    | 20             | -1.67            |
| T = 2    | 40             | -3.33            |
| T = 3    | 60             | -5               |

#### **2. Bypass Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7)**
- **Lateral Position**: Maintain Y = -5.
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Constant speed of 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m) = 60 + 20 * (T - 3) | Y (m) = -5 |
|----------|---------------------------|------------|
| T = 3    | 60                        | -5         |
| T = 4    | 80                        | -5         |
| T = 5    | 100                       | -5         |
| T = 6    | 120                       | -5         |
| T = 7    | 140                       | -5         |

#### **3. Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10)**
- **Lateral Movement**: Linear transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0.
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Constant speed of 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m) = 140 + 20 * (T - 7) | Y (m) = -5 + 5/3 * (T - 7) |
|----------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| T = 7    | 140                        | -5                         |
| T = 8    | 160                        | -3.33                      |
| T = 9    | 180                        | -1.67                      |
| T = 10   | 200                        | 0                          |

### **Summary of Positions**
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| T = 0    | 0     | 0     |
| T = 1    | 20    | -1.67 |
| T = 2    | 40    | -3.33 |
| T = 3    | 60    | -5    |
| T = 4    | 80    | -5    |
| T = 5    | 100   | -5    |
| T = 6    | 120   | -5    |
| T = 7    | 140   | -5    |
| T = 8    | 160   | -3.33 |
| T = 9    | 180   | -1.67 |
| T = 10   | 200   | 0     |

### **Verification**
1. **Speed**: Maintained above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s) throughout.
2. **Obstruction Bypass**: Successfully avoided the obstruction at X = 100 by being in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
3. **Lane Transitions**: Smoothly transitioned to and from the adjacent lane.

This plan ensures a safe and efficient bypass of the obstruction.
