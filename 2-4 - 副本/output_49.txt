To plan the route, we'll break down the vehicle's movement into critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. The goal is to transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5), bypass the obstruction at X = 100, and return to the original lane (Y = 0) while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s). Here's the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Assumptions and Calculations**
1. **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
2. **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.
3. **Lateral Movement**: Transitioning to the adjacent lane requires a smooth lateral shift over a short distance. Assume a lateral speed of 1 m/s for simplicity.
4. **Obstruction Position**: Located at X = 100 meters, Y = 0.
5. **Time Intervals**: We'll calculate the vehicle's position every second (T = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10).

### **Route Plan**
1. **T = 0**: Starting position = (0, 0).
2. **T = 1**: Begin lateral movement toward the adjacent lane.  
   - X = 20 m (20 m/s ¡Á 1 s).  
   - Y = -1 m (1 m/s ¡Á 1 s).  
   - Position = (20, -1).
3. **T = 2**: Continue lateral movement.  
   - X = 40 m.  
   - Y = -2 m.  
   - Position = (40, -2).
4. **T = 3**: Continue lateral movement.  
   - X = 60 m.  
   - Y = -3 m.  
   - Position = (60, -3).
5. **T = 4**: Continue lateral movement.  
   - X = 80 m.  
   - Y = -4 m.  
   - Position = (80, -4).
6. **T = 5**: Complete transition to the adjacent lane.  
   - X = 100 m.  
   - Y = -5 m.  
   - Position = (100, -5).  
   - **Note**: At this point, the vehicle has bypassed the obstruction.
7. **T = 6**: Begin lateral movement back to the original lane.  
   - X = 120 m.  
   - Y = -4 m.  
   - Position = (120, -4).
8. **T = 7**: Continue lateral movement.  
   - X = 140 m.  
   - Y = -3 m.  
   - Position = (140, -3).
9. **T = 8**: Continue lateral movement.  
   - X = 160 m.  
   - Y = -2 m.  
   - Position = (160, -2).
10. **T = 9**: Continue lateral movement.  
    - X = 180 m.  
    - Y = -1 m.  
    - Position = (180, -1).
11. **T = 10**: Complete transition back to the original lane.  
    - X = 200 m.  
    - Y = 0 m.  
    - Position = (200, 0).

### **Summary of Positions**
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|-----------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -1)        |
| 2        | (40, -2)        |
| 3        | (60, -3)        |
| 4        | (80, -4)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -4)       |
| 7        | (140, -3)       |
| 8        | (160, -2)       |
| 9        | (180, -1)       |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

### **Key Points**
- The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
- The lateral movement is smooth and takes 5 seconds to transition to the adjacent lane and another 5 seconds to return to the original lane.
- The obstruction at X = 100 is successfully bypassed while staying in the adjacent lane.

This plan ensures the vehicle navigates around the obstruction safely and efficiently.
