To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the vehicle's movement into critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. We'll calculate the vehicle's position (X, Y) at each second, ensuring the speed remains above 60 km/h and the lane transitions are smooth.

### Given:
- **Initial position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Obstruction position**: (X, Y) = (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5
- **Initial velocity**: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)

### Assumptions:
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
2. The lane change is completed linearly over 2 seconds (from T = 0 to T = 2).
3. The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) from T = 2 to T = 6.
4. The vehicle returns to the original lane (Y = 0) linearly over 2 seconds (from T = 6 to T = 8).
5. The vehicle continues in the original lane from T = 8 to T = 10.

### Calculations:
- **Distance traveled per second**: 20 meters (since speed is 20 m/s)
- **Lane change rate**: From Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds, so ¦¤Y = -2.5 m/s
- **Lane return rate**: From Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds, so ¦¤Y = 2.5 m/s

### Position Estimates:
- **T = 0**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **T = 1**: (X, Y) = (20, -2.5)
- **T = 2**: (X, Y) = (40, -5)
- **T = 3**: (X, Y) = (60, -5)
- **T = 4**: (X, Y) = (80, -5)
- **T = 5**: (X, Y) = (100, -5)
- **T = 6**: (X, Y) = (120, -5)
- **T = 7**: (X, Y) = (140, -2.5)
- **T = 8**: (X, Y) = (160, 0)
- **T = 9**: (X, Y) = (180, 0)
- **T = 10**: (X, Y) = (200, 0)

### Summary:
- **Lane change**: Completed by T = 2, with the vehicle fully in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
- **Bypassing obstruction**: The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane from T = 2 to T = 6, bypassing the obstruction at X = 100.
- **Lane return**: Completed by T = 8, with the vehicle fully back in the original lane (Y = 0).
- **Continued travel**: The vehicle continues in the original lane from T = 8 to T = 10.

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h and safely navigates around the obstruction.
