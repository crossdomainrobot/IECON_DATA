To construct a route planning for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**

### Given:
- **Initial Position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)  
- **Obstruction Position**: (100, 0)  
- **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5  
- **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h (20 m/s)  
- **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)  
- **Time Interval**: 10 seconds  

---

### Assumptions:
- The lane change takes **2 seconds** in each direction (to and from the adjacent lane).  
- During the lane change, the vehicle maintains a constant speed of **20 m/s** (72 km/h).  
- The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane for **6 seconds** to bypass the obstruction.

### Route Planning:

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2)**  
- **Velocity**: 20 m/s  
- **Lateral Movement**: Y transitions from 0 to -5 over 2 seconds.  
- **Positions**:  
  - T = 1: (20, -2.5)  
  - T = 2: (40, -5)  

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 8)**  
- **Velocity**: 20 m/s  
- **Lateral Position**: Y = -5 (stays in adjacent lane)  
- **Positions**:  
  - T = 3: (60, -5)  
  - T = 4: (80, -5)  
  - T = 5: (100, -5)  
  - T = 6: (120, -5)  
  - T = 7: (140, -5)  
  - T = 8: (160, -5)  

#### **Phase 3: Lane Change Back to Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)**  
- **Velocity**: 20 m/s  
- **Lateral Movement**: Y transitions from -5 to 0 over 2 seconds.  
- **Positions**:  
  - T = 9: (180, -2.5)  
  - T = 10: (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions (X, Y) at Critical Intervals:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |  
| 2        | 40    | -5    |  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    |  
| 7        | 140   | -5    |  
| 8        | 160   | -5    |  
| 9        | 180   | -2.5  |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### Notes:
- The vehicle successfully bypasses the obstruction at X = 100 while staying in the adjacent lane.  
- Speed is maintained above 60 km/h throughout the maneuver.  
- The total distance traveled in 10 seconds is 200 meters.
