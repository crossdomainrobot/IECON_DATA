To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the vehicle's movement into critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. The vehicle starts at (0, 0) with an initial velocity of 72 km/h (20 m/s) and must maintain a speed above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s). The adjacent lane is at Y = -5, and the obstruction is at (100, 0).

### Assumptions:
1. The vehicle transitions laterally at a constant rate.
2. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
3. The lateral transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) takes 2 seconds.
4. The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane until it has bypassed the obstruction at X = 100.
5. The vehicle transitions back to the original lane (Y = 0) after bypassing the obstruction, which also takes 2 seconds.

### Critical Intervals:
1. **T = 0 to T = 2 seconds**: Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
2. **T = 2 to T = 5 seconds**: Travel in the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction.
3. **T = 5 to T = 7 seconds**: Transition back to the original lane (Y = 0).
4. **T = 7 to T = 10 seconds**: Continue traveling in the original lane.

### Position Estimates:
- **T = 0 seconds**: (0, 0)
- **T = 1 second**: (20, -2.5) ！ Halfway through the lane transition.
- **T = 2 seconds**: (40, -5) ！ Fully transitioned to the adjacent lane.
- **T = 3 seconds**: (60, -5) ！ Traveling in the adjacent lane.
- **T = 4 seconds**: (80, -5) ！ Traveling in the adjacent lane.
- **T = 5 seconds**: (100, -5) ！ Bypassed the obstruction.
- **T = 6 seconds**: (120, -2.5) ！ Halfway through transitioning back to the original lane.
- **T = 7 seconds**: (140, 0) ！ Fully transitioned back to the original lane.
- **T = 8 seconds**: (160, 0) ！ Continuing in the original lane.
- **T = 9 seconds**: (180, 0) ！ Continuing in the original lane.
- **T = 10 seconds**: (200, 0) ！ Continuing in the original lane.

### Summary of Positions:
- **T = 0**: (0, 0)
- **T = 1**: (20, -2.5)
- **T = 2**: (40, -5)
- **T = 3**: (60, -5)
- **T = 4**: (80, -5)
- **T = 5**: (100, -5)
- **T = 6**: (120, -2.5)
- **T = 7**: (140, 0)
- **T = 8**: (160, 0)
- **T = 9**: (180, 0)
- **T = 10**: (200, 0)

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h and safely transitions back to the original lane.
