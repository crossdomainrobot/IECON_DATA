### Understanding the Problem

First, let's break down the scenario:

- **Road Layout**: Two parallel lanes. I'm currently in the outer lane, which we'll consider as the starting position (0,0).
  
- **Obstacle**: There's an unexpected obstruction directly ahead at (100,0). This means it's 100 meters away in the same lane.

- **Lane Transition**: To avoid the obstacle, I need to move to the adjacent lane, which has a Y-coordinate of -5. After bypassing the obstacle, I should return to my original lane.

- **Speed Constraints**: My initial speed is 72 km/h, and I must maintain a speed above 60 km/h throughout the maneuver.

- **Time Frame**: We need to plan the vehicle's position every second for the next 10 seconds.

### Converting Speed to Meters per Second

Since our positions are in meters and time in seconds, it's practical to convert the speed from km/h to m/s.

\[ \text{Speed in m/s} = \text{Speed in km/h} \times \frac{1000 \text{ meters}}{3600 \text{ seconds}} \]

\[ 72 \text{ km/h} = 72 \times \frac{1000}{3600} = 20 \text{ m/s} \]

\[ 60 \text{ km/h} = 60 \times \frac{1000}{3600} \approx 16.67 \text{ m/s} \]

So, I must maintain a speed above 16.67 m/s.

### Planning the Lane Transition

To navigate around the obstacle, I'll need to:

1. **Change to the adjacent lane (Y = -5)**.
2. **Bypass the obstacle at X = 100**.
3. **Return to the original lane (Y = 0)**.

Let's assume that the lane change takes a certain amount of time and distance. For simplicity, we'll consider that the lane change occurs linearly over a short period.

### Estimating Positions Over Time

We'll calculate the vehicle's position every second for 10 seconds. Here's how we'll approach it:

1. **Initial Position (T = 0)**: (0, 0)
2. **Determine when to start the lane change**: We need to ensure that we're in the adjacent lane before reaching the obstacle at X = 100.
3. **Calculate X and Y positions at each second**.

Let's assume that the lane change starts at T = 2 seconds and is completed by T = 4 seconds. This gives us a smooth transition.

### Detailed Position Calculations

Let's create a table to track the vehicle's position at each second.

| Time (s) | X Position (m) | Y Position (m) | Notes |
|----------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| 0        | 0              | 0              | Starting point |
| 1        | 20             | 0              | Moving straight |
| 2        | 40             | 0              | Start lane change |
| 3        | 60             | -2.5           | Midway in lane change |
| 4        | 80             | -5             | Lane change complete |
| 5        | 100            | -5             | Bypassing obstacle |
| 6        | 120            | -5             | Continue in adjacent lane |
| 7        | 140            | -5             | Prepare to return |
| 8        | 160            | -2.5           | Start returning to original lane |
| 9        | 180            | 0              | Return to original lane complete |
| 10       | 200            | 0              | Continue in original lane |

**Explanation of Calculations:**

- **X Position**: Since the speed is 20 m/s, each second the vehicle moves 20 meters along the X-axis.
  
- **Y Position**:
  - **T = 0 to T = 1**: Moving straight, Y remains 0.
  - **T = 2 to T = 4**: Lane change from Y = 0 to Y = -5. Assuming a linear change:
    - At T = 2: Y = 0
    - At T = 3: Y = -2.5 (midway)
    - At T = 4: Y = -5
  - **T = 5 to T = 7**: Continue in the adjacent lane, Y remains -5.
  - **T = 8 to T = 9**: Return to the original lane from Y = -5 to Y = 0.
    - At T = 8: Y = -2.5
    - At T = 9: Y = 0
  - **T = 10**: Continue in the original lane, Y remains 0.

### Verifying Speed Constraints

Throughout the maneuver, the vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s, which is above the required minimum of 16.67 m/s. Therefore, the speed constraint is satisfied.

### Final Route Plan

Based on the calculations, here's the vehicle's position at each second:

- **T = 0**: (0, 0)
- **T = 1**: (20, 0)
- **T = 2**: (40, 0)
- **T = 3**: (60, -2.5)
- **T = 4**: (80, -5)
- **T = 5**: (100, -5)
- **T = 6**: (120, -5)
- **T = 7**: (140, -5)
- **T = 8**: (160, -2.5)
- **T = 9**: (180, 0)
- **T = 10**: (200, 0)

### Conclusion

By following this route plan, the vehicle successfully navigates around the obstacle while maintaining the required speed. The lane changes are executed smoothly over a few seconds, ensuring safety and efficiency in the maneuver.
