To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into phases: transitioning to the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals for 10 seconds. The vehicle¡¯s initial velocity is 72 km/h (20 m/s), and it must maintain a speed above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).

### Assumptions:
1. **Lane Width**: The adjacent lane is at \( Y = -5 \) meters.
2. **Obstruction**: Located at \( X = 100 \) meters.
3. **Speed**: Maintained at 20 m/s (72 km/h).
4. **Lane Change Duration**: We¡¯ll assume it takes 2 seconds to transition between lanes (smoothly changing \( Y \)-position).

### Route Plan:
1. **Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2)**:
   - Move from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \) meters while continuing to travel forward at 20 m/s.
2. **Bypassing Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)**:
   - Travel in the adjacent lane \( Y = -5 \) meters, ensuring the obstruction at \( X = 100 \) is bypassed.
3. **Lane Return (T = 6 to T = 8)**:
   - Move from \( Y = -5 \) back to \( Y = 0 \) meters while continuing to travel forward at 20 m/s.
4. **Continue in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)**:
   - Travel in the original lane \( Y = 0 \) meters.

### Position Calculations:
- **X-Position**: At 20 m/s, the vehicle travels 20 meters each second.
- **Y-Position**: Smooth transition between lanes over 2 seconds.

#### Critical Intervals:
| Time (s) | X-Position (m) | Y-Position (m) |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| T = 0    | 0              | 0              |
| T = 1    | 20             | -2.5           |
| T = 2    | 40             | -5             |
| T = 3    | 60             | -5             |
| T = 4    | 80             | -5             |
| T = 5    | 100            | -5             |
| T = 6    | 120            | -5             |
| T = 7    | 140            | -2.5           |
| T = 8    | 160            | 0              |
| T = 9    | 180            | 0              |
| T = 10   | 200            | 0              |

### Explanation:
1. **Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2)**:
   - The vehicle moves laterally from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \) meters over 2 seconds, with \( Y \) changing linearly.
2. **Bypassing Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)**:
   - The vehicle stays in the adjacent lane (\( Y = -5 \)) and bypasses the obstruction at \( X = 100 \) meters.
3. **Lane Return (T = 6 to T = 8)**:
   - The vehicle moves back to the original lane (\( Y = 0 \)) over 2 seconds.
4. **Continue in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)**:
   - The vehicle continues traveling in the original lane.

This plan ensures the obstruction is bypassed safely while maintaining the required speed.
