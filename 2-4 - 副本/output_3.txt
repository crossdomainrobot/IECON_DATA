To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into phases and calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals. Here¡¯s the step-by-step plan:

---

### **1. Initial Conditions**
- Starting position: \((X, Y) = (0, 0)\)
- Obstruction position: \((100, 0)\)
- Adjacent lane Y-coordinate: \(Y = -5\)
- Initial velocity: \(72 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s}\)
- Minimum speed: \(60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s}\)

---

### **2. Assumptions**
- Lane change duration: 3 seconds (transition from \(Y = 0\) to \(Y = -5\))
- Bypass duration: 4 seconds (maintain \(Y = -5\) to avoid the obstruction)
- Return to original lane duration: 3 seconds (transition from \(Y = -5\) to \(Y = 0\))
- Total maneuver time: 10 seconds

---

### **3. Position Calculations**
The vehicle¡¯s position \((X, Y)\) at each second is calculated as follows:

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)**
- \(Y\) changes linearly from \(0\) to \(-5\) over 3 seconds.
- \(X\) increases at \(20 \, \text{m/s}\).

| Time (s) | \(X\) (m) | \(Y\) (m) |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 0        | 0         | 0         |
| 1        | 20        | -1.67     |
| 2        | 40        | -3.33     |
| 3        | 60        | -5        |

#### **Phase 2: Bypass Obstruction (T = 4 to T = 6 seconds)**
- Maintain \(Y = -5\).
- \(X\) increases at \(20 \, \text{m/s}\).

| Time (s) | \(X\) (m) | \(Y\) (m) |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 4        | 80        | -5        |
| 5        | 100       | -5        |
| 6        | 120       | -5        |

#### **Phase 3: Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds)**
- \(Y\) changes linearly from \(-5\) to \(0\) over 3 seconds.
- \(X\) increases at \(20 \, \text{m/s}\).

| Time (s) | \(X\) (m) | \(Y\) (m) |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 7        | 140       | -3.33     |
| 8        | 160       | -1.67     |
| 9        | 180       | 0         |
| 10       | 200       | 0         |

---

### **4. Summary of Positions**
Here are the vehicle¡¯s positions at 1-second intervals:

| Time (s) | \(X\) (m) | \(Y\) (m) |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 0        | 0         | 0         |
| 1        | 20        | -1.67     |
| 2        | 40        | -3.33     |
| 3        | 60        | -5        |
| 4        | 80        | -5        |
| 5        | 100       | -5        |
| 6        | 120       | -5        |
| 7        | 140       | -3.33     |
| 8        | 160       | -1.67     |
| 9        | 180       | 0         |
| 10       | 200       | 0         |

### **5. Key Points**
- The vehicle successfully avoids the obstruction at \(X = 100\) by being in the adjacent lane (\(Y = -5\)) at that time.
- Speed is maintained above \(60 \, \text{km/h}\) throughout the maneuver.
- The vehicle returns to the original lane (\(Y = 0\)) after bypassing the obstruction.
