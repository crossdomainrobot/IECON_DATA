To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the vehicle's movement into critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. The vehicle starts at (0, 0) with an initial velocity of 72 km/h (20 m/s) and must maintain a speed above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s). The adjacent lane is at Y = -5, and the obstruction is at (100, 0).

### Assumptions:
1. **Lane Transition Time**: We assume it takes 2 seconds to transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) and another 2 seconds to return.
2. **Bypass Distance**: The vehicle will stay in the adjacent lane from X = 80 to X = 120 to ensure a safe bypass of the obstruction at X = 100.
3. **Constant Speed**: The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.

### Critical Intervals:
1. **T = 0 to T = 2 seconds**: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
2. **T = 2 to T = 6 seconds**: Travel in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) to bypass the obstruction.
3. **T = 6 to T = 8 seconds**: Transition back from Y = -5 to Y = 0.
4. **T = 8 to T = 10 seconds**: Continue traveling in the original lane (Y = 0).

### Position Estimates:
- **T = 0 seconds**: (0, 0)
- **T = 1 second**: (20, -2.5) ！ Midway through the lane transition.
- **T = 2 seconds**: (40, -5) ！ Fully in the adjacent lane.
- **T = 3 seconds**: (60, -5) ！ Continuing in the adjacent lane.
- **T = 4 seconds**: (80, -5) ！ Entering the bypass zone.
- **T = 5 seconds**: (100, -5) ！ Directly opposite the obstruction.
- **T = 6 seconds**: (120, -5) ！ Exiting the bypass zone.
- **T = 7 seconds**: (140, -2.5) ！ Midway through returning to the original lane.
- **T = 8 seconds**: (160, 0) ！ Fully back in the original lane.
- **T = 9 seconds**: (180, 0) ！ Continuing in the original lane.
- **T = 10 seconds**: (200, 0) ！ Final position.

### Summary of Positions:
- **T = 0**: (0, 0)
- **T = 1**: (20, -2.5)
- **T = 2**: (40, -5)
- **T = 3**: (60, -5)
- **T = 4**: (80, -5)
- **T = 5**: (100, -5)
- **T = 6**: (120, -5)
- **T = 7**: (140, -2.5)
- **T = 8**: (160, 0)
- **T = 9**: (180, 0)
- **T = 10**: (200, 0)

This plan ensures the vehicle safely bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
