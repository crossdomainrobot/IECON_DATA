To construct a route plan, we need to calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at critical intervals over the next 10 seconds while transitioning lanes, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. Here¡¯s the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Key Parameters**
- **Initial velocity**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s
- **Minimum speed**: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s
- **Obstruction**: Located at (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane**: Y = -5
- **Starting point**: (0, 0)
- **Time interval**: 1 second

---

### **Assumptions**
1. The vehicle accelerates/decelerates smoothly to maintain speed above 60 km/h.
2. Lane transitions take 2 seconds each (1 second to move laterally and 1 second to stabilize).
3. The vehicle bypasses the obstruction between X = 100 and X = 120.

---

### **Route Plan**
1. **T = 0 to T = 2**: Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
2. **T = 2 to T = 6**: Bypass the obstruction (X = 100 to X = 120).
3. **T = 6 to T = 8**: Transition back to the original lane (Y = 0).
4. **T = 8 to T = 10**: Continue in the original lane.

### **Position Estimates**
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) | Description                     |
|----------|-------|-------|---------------------------------|
| T = 0    | 0     | 0     | Starting point                  |
| T = 1    | 20    | -2.5  | Transitioning to adjacent lane  |
| T = 2    | 40    | -5    | Fully in adjacent lane          |
| T = 3    | 60    | -5    | Bypassing obstruction           |
| T = 4    | 80    | -5    | Bypassing obstruction           |
| T = 5    | 100   | -5    | Reaching obstruction            |
| T = 6    | 120   | -5    | Fully bypassed obstruction      |
| T = 7    | 140   | -2.5  | Transitioning back to original lane |
| T = 8    | 160   | 0     | Fully in original lane          |
| T = 9    | 180   | 0     | Continuing in original lane     |
| T = 10   | 200   | 0     | Continuing in original lane     |

### **Explanation**
1. **Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2)**:
   - The vehicle moves laterally from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.
   - X increases linearly at 20 m/s.

2. **Bypassing Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)**:
   - The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while moving past the obstruction at X = 100.

3. **Returning to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)**:
   - The vehicle moves laterally from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.

4. **Continuing in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)**:
   - The vehicle maintains its position in the original lane (Y = 0) while moving forward.

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h and safely navigates around the obstruction.
