To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we need to break down the maneuver into key steps and calculate the vehicle's position at critical intervals. Here¡¯s how we can approach this:

### Step 1: Convert Speed to Meters per Second (m/s)
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h
- Convert to m/s: \( 72 \times \frac{1000}{3600} = 20 \) m/s
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h ¡ú \( 60 \times \frac{1000}{3600} = 16.67 \) m/s

### Step 2: Define the Maneuver
1. **Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):** Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
2. **Bypass the Obstruction:** Maintain Y = -5 while passing X = 100.
3. **Return to Original Lane (Y = 0):** Transition from Y = -5 back to Y = 0.

### Step 3: Estimate Time for Each Phase
Assume the lane change takes 2 seconds each (to and from the adjacent lane). The bypass phase will take the remaining time.

### Step 4: Calculate Positions at 1-Second Intervals
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at each second (T = 1, 2, ..., 10).

#### Phase 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2)
- **T = 0:** (0, 0)
- **T = 1:** (20, -2.5) ¡ú Halfway through the lane change.
- **T = 2:** (40, -5) ¡ú Fully in the adjacent lane.

#### Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 8)
- **T = 3:** (60, -5)
- **T = 4:** (80, -5)
- **T = 5:** (100, -5) ¡ú Passing the obstruction.
- **T = 6:** (120, -5)
- **T = 7:** (140, -5)
- **T = 8:** (160, -5)

#### Phase 3: Return to Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)
- **T = 9:** (180, -2.5) ¡ú Halfway back to the original lane.
- **T = 10:** (200, 0) ¡ú Fully back in the original lane.

### Step 5: Summary of Positions
| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|-----------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |
| 2        | (40, -5)        |
| 3        | (60, -5)        |
| 4        | (80, -5)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -5)       |
| 7        | (140, -5)       |
| 8        | (160, -5)       |
| 9        | (180, -2.5)     |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

### Step 6: Verify Speed
- Distance traveled in 10 seconds: 200 meters.
- Average speed: \( \frac{200}{10} = 20 \) m/s (72 km/h), which exceeds the minimum requirement of 16.67 m/s (60 km/h).

This plan ensures a smooth lane change, bypasses the obstruction, and returns to the original lane while maintaining the required speed.
