To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into phases and estimate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals. Here¡¯s the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Given:**
- Starting position: \((X, Y) = (0, 0)\)
- Obstruction position: \((100, 0)\)
- Adjacent lane position: \(Y = -5\)
- Initial velocity: \(72 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s}\)
- Minimum speed: \(60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s}\)

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle transitions smoothly between lanes over a 2-second interval.
2. The vehicle bypasses the obstruction by moving into the adjacent lane \(Y = -5\) and returns to the original lane \(Y = 0\) after passing the obstruction.
3. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of \(20 \, \text{m/s}\) during the maneuver.

---

### **Phase 1: Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2)**
- Transition from \(Y = 0\) to \(Y = -5\) over 2 seconds.
- Lateral velocity: \(\frac{-5}{2} = -2.5 \, \text{m/s}\).

---

### **Phase 2: Bypass Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 5)**
- Maintain position in the adjacent lane \(Y = -5\).
- Bypass the obstruction at \(X = 100\).

---

### **Phase 3: Lane Transition (T = 5 to T = 7)**
- Transition from \(Y = -5\) to \(Y = 0\) over 2 seconds.
- Lateral velocity: \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \, \text{m/s}\).

---

### **Position Estimates:**
The vehicle¡¯s position \((X, Y)\) is calculated at 1-second intervals using \(X = 20T\) and the lateral position \(Y\) based on the phase.

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m)    | Phase                     |
|----------|-------|----------|---------------------------|
| T = 0    | 0     | 0        | Starting position         |
| T = 1    | 20    | -2.5     | Lane transition           |
| T = 2    | 40    | -5       | Enter adjacent lane       |
| T = 3    | 60    | -5       | Bypass obstruction        |
| T = 4    | 80    | -5       | Bypass obstruction        |
| T = 5    | 100   | -5       | Pass obstruction          |
| T = 6    | 120   | -2.5     | Lane transition           |
| T = 7    | 140   | 0        | Return to original lane   |
| T = 8    | 160   | 0        | Continue in original lane |
| T = 9    | 180   | 0        | Continue in original lane |
| T = 10   | 200   | 0        | Continue in original lane |

---

### **Summary:**
- The vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane by \(T = 2\).
- It bypasses the obstruction at \(T = 5\).
- It returns to the original lane by \(T = 7\).
- The speed remains constant at \(20 \, \text{m/s}\) throughout the maneuver.

This plan ensures the vehicle navigates around the obstruction safely while maintaining the required speed.
