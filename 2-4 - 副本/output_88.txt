To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the vehicle's movement into critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. We'll calculate the vehicle's position (X, Y) at each second, ensuring the speed remains above 60 km/h and the lane transitions are smooth.

### Given:
- **Initial position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Obstruction position**: (X, Y) = (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5
- **Initial velocity**: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)

### Assumptions:
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
2. The lane change is executed linearly over a short distance.
3. The vehicle starts the lane change at T = 2 seconds and completes it by T = 4 seconds.
4. The vehicle returns to the original lane starting at T = 6 seconds and completes the return by T = 8 seconds.

### Route Planning:

#### 1. **Initial Movement (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)**:
   - The vehicle continues in the outer lane (Y = 0) at 20 m/s.
   - **Position at T = 1 second**: (20, 0)
   - **Position at T = 2 seconds**: (40, 0)

#### 2. **Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (T = 2 to T = 4 seconds)**:
   - The vehicle transitions from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.
   - **Position at T = 3 seconds**: (60, -2.5)
   - **Position at T = 4 seconds**: (80, -5)

#### 3. **Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 4 to T = 6 seconds)**:
   - The vehicle continues in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) at 20 m/s.
   - **Position at T = 5 seconds**: (100, -5)
   - **Position at T = 6 seconds**: (120, -5)

#### 4. **Returning to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)**:
   - The vehicle transitions from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.
   - **Position at T = 7 seconds**: (140, -2.5)
   - **Position at T = 8 seconds**: (160, 0)

#### 5. **Continuing in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds)**:
   - The vehicle continues in the outer lane (Y = 0) at 20 m/s.
   - **Position at T = 9 seconds**: (180, 0)
   - **Position at T = 10 seconds**: (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions:
- **T = 0 seconds**: (0, 0)
- **T = 1 second**: (20, 0)
- **T = 2 seconds**: (40, 0)
- **T = 3 seconds**: (60, -2.5)
- **T = 4 seconds**: (80, -5)
- **T = 5 seconds**: (100, -5)
- **T = 6 seconds**: (120, -5)
- **T = 7 seconds**: (140, -2.5)
- **T = 8 seconds**: (160, 0)
- **T = 9 seconds**: (180, 0)
- **T = 10 seconds**: (200, 0)

This plan ensures the vehicle navigates around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h and smoothly transitions between lanes.
