To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we need to ensure that the vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane, bypasses the obstruction, and returns to the original lane while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h. Here¡¯s the step-by-step plan:

---

### Assumptions:
1. **Initial State**:  
   - Starting position: \( (X, Y) = (0, 0) \).  
   - Speed: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.  
   - Obstacle position: \( (100, 0) \).  
   - Adjacent lane: \( Y = -5 \).  

2. **Lane Transition**:  
   - The lane change is assumed to take 2 seconds (smooth transition).  
   - The vehicle will stay in the adjacent lane until it clears the obstruction.  

3. **Time Intervals**:  
   - Analyze the vehicle¡¯s position every second for 10 seconds.  

---

### Plan:
1. **Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2)**:  
   - Transition from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \).  
   - Lateral speed: \( \frac{-5}{2} = -2.5 \, \text{m/s} \).  

2. **Bypass Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 5)**:  
   - Stay in the adjacent lane (\( Y = -5 \)) until the vehicle clears the obstruction at \( X = 100 \).  

3. **Return to Original Lane (T = 5 to T = 7)**:  
   - Transition from \( Y = -5 \) to \( Y = 0 \).  
   - Lateral speed: \( \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \, \text{m/s} \).  

4. **Continue in Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10)**:  
   - Maintain \( Y = 0 \).  

---

### Position Estimates:
- **Longitudinal Distance (X)**:  
  \( X(t) = X(0) + v \cdot t = 0 + 20 \cdot t \).  

- **Lateral Position (Y)**:  
  - \( T = 0 \) to \( T = 2 \): \( Y(t) = -2.5 \cdot t \).  
  - \( T = 2 \) to \( T = 5 \): \( Y(t) = -5 \).  
  - \( T = 5 \) to \( T = 7 \): \( Y(t) = -5 + 2.5 \cdot (t - 5) \).  
  - \( T = 7 \) to \( T = 10 \): \( Y(t) = 0 \).

### Critical Positions:
| Time (s) | \( X \) (m) | \( Y \) (m) | Description                     |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------------------------|
| 0        | 0           | 0           | Start                           |
| 1        | 20          | -2.5        | Lane change in progress         |
| 2        | 40          | -5          | Fully in adjacent lane          |
| 3        | 60          | -5          | Bypassing obstruction           |
| 4        | 80          | -5          | Bypassing obstruction           |
| 5        | 100         | -5          | Cleared obstruction             |
| 6        | 120         | -2.5        | Returning to original lane      |
| 7        | 140         | 0           | Fully in original lane          |
| 8        | 160         | 0           | Continuing in original lane     |
| 9        | 180         | 0           | Continuing in original lane     |
| 10       | 200         | 0           | Continuing in original lane     |

### Verification:
- **Speed**: The vehicle maintains 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout, satisfying the >60 km/h requirement.  
- **Obstacle Clearance**: The vehicle is in the adjacent lane (\( Y = -5 \)) when \( X = 100 \), ensuring safe bypass.  
- **Lane Transitions**: Smooth transitions are completed within 2 seconds each.  

This plan ensures safe and efficient navigation around the obstruction.
