To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the movement into phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**
2. **Bypass the Obstruction (X = 100)**
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**

### Assumptions:
- **Initial Velocity:** 72 km/h = 20 m/s
- **Minimum Speed:** 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s
- **Lane Width:** 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane)
- **Obstruction Location:** (100, 0)
- **Time Step:** 1 second

### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)
We¡¯ll assume the lane change takes **2 seconds**, during which the vehicle moves laterally from Y = 0 to Y = -5 while maintaining a speed of 20 m/s.

- **T = 0 s:** (0, 0)
- **T = 1 s:** (20, -2.5)  
  (Halfway through the lane change)
- **T = 2 s:** (40, -5)  
  (Lane change complete)

### Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction (X = 100)
The vehicle continues in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until it has bypassed the obstruction at X = 100.

- **T = 3 s:** (60, -5)
- **T = 4 s:** (80, -5)
- **T = 5 s:** (100, -5)  
  (Obstruction bypassed)

### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)
We¡¯ll assume the lane change back takes **2 seconds**, during which the vehicle moves laterally from Y = -5 to Y = 0 while maintaining a speed of 20 m/s.

- **T = 6 s:** (120, -2.5)  
  (Halfway through the lane change)
- **T = 7 s:** (140, 0)  
  (Lane change complete)

### Final Positions:
- **T = 8 s:** (160, 0)
- **T = 9 s:** (180, 0)
- **T = 10 s:** (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|-----------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |
| 2        | (40, -5)        |
| 3        | (60, -5)        |
| 4        | (80, -5)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -2.5)     |
| 7        | (140, 0)        |
| 8        | (160, 0)        |
| 9        | (180, 0)        |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h while safely navigating around the obstruction.
