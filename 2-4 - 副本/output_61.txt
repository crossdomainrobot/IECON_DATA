To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the vehicle's movement into key phases: transitioning to the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. We'll estimate the vehicle's position at 1-second intervals (T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10) while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).

### **Given:**
- **Starting position:** (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Obstruction position:** (X, Y) = (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate:** Y = -5
- **Initial velocity:** 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum speed:** 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)

### **Route Plan:**

#### **Phase 1: Transition to the adjacent lane (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)**
- **Lateral movement:** Move from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds.
- **Speed:** Maintain 20 m/s (72 km/h).
- **Distance traveled per second:** 20 meters.

| Time (T) | X Position | Y Position |
|----------|------------|------------|
| 0        | 0          | 0          |
| 1        | 20         | -1.67      |
| 2        | 40         | -3.33      |
| 3        | 60         | -5         |

---

#### **Phase 2: Bypass the obstruction (T = 3 to T = 6 seconds)**
- **Lateral movement:** Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
- **Speed:** Maintain 20 m/s (72 km/h).
- **Distance traveled per second:** 20 meters.

| Time (T) | X Position | Y Position |
|----------|------------|------------|
| 4        | 80         | -5         |
| 5        | 100        | -5         |
| 6        | 120        | -5         |

---

#### **Phase 3: Return to the original lane (T = 6 to T = 9 seconds)**
- **Lateral movement:** Move from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.
- **Speed:** Maintain 20 m/s (72 km/h).
- **Distance traveled per second:** 20 meters.

| Time (T) | X Position | Y Position |
|----------|------------|------------|
| 7        | 140        | -3.33      |
| 8        | 160        | -1.67      |
| 9        | 180        | 0          |

---

#### **Phase 4: Continue in the original lane (T = 9 to T = 10 seconds)**
- **Lateral movement:** Stay in the original lane (Y = 0).
- **Speed:** Maintain 20 m/s (72 km/h).
- **Distance traveled per second:** 20 meters.

| Time (T) | X Position | Y Position |
|----------|------------|------------|
| 10       | 200        | 0          |

### **Summary of Positions:**

| Time (T) | X Position | Y Position |
|----------|------------|------------|
| 0        | 0          | 0          |
| 1        | 20         | -1.67      |
| 2        | 40         | -3.33      |
| 3        | 60         | -5         |
| 4        | 80         | -5         |
| 5        | 100        | -5         |
| 6        | 120        | -5         |
| 7        | 140        | -3.33      |
| 8        | 160        | -1.67      |
| 9        | 180        | 0          |
| 10       | 200        | 0          |

### **Key Points:**
1. The vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane over 3 seconds (T = 0 to T = 3).
2. The vehicle bypasses the obstruction between T = 3 and T = 6, staying in the adjacent lane.
3. The vehicle returns to the original lane over the next 3 seconds (T = 6 to T = 9).
4. The vehicle continues in the original lane at T = 10.
5. The speed remains above 60 km/h throughout the maneuver.
