To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we need to break down the maneuver into key phases: lane transition, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. Here's a step-by-step estimation of the vehicle's position at 1-second intervals over the next 10 seconds, assuming a constant speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s). The adjacent lane is at Y = -5.

### Key Phases:
1. **Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2.5 seconds):** Move from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
2. **Bypassing Obstruction (T = 2.5 to T = 7.5 seconds):** Continue in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until X > 100.
3. **Return to Original Lane (T = 7.5 to T = 10 seconds):** Move from Y = -5 back to Y = 0.

### Position Estimates:
1. **T = 0 seconds:**  
   - X = 0, Y = 0 (starting point).
2. **T = 1 second:**  
   - X = 20 (velocity * time = 20 m/s * 1 s).  
   - Y = -2 (transitioning to adjacent lane).
3. **T = 2 seconds:**  
   - X = 40.  
   - Y = -4 (continuing lane transition).
4. **T = 2.5 seconds:**  
   - X = 50.  
   - Y = -5 (fully in adjacent lane).
5. **T = 3 seconds:**  
   - X = 60.  
   - Y = -5 (maintaining lane).
6. **T = 4 seconds:**  
   - X = 80.  
   - Y = -5 (maintaining lane).
7. **T = 5 seconds:**  
   - X = 100.  
   - Y = -5 (approaching obstruction).
8. **T = 6 seconds:**  
   - X = 120.  
   - Y = -5 (bypassing obstruction).
9. **T = 7 seconds:**  
   - X = 140.  
   - Y = -5 (maintaining lane).
10. **T = 7.5 seconds:**  
    - X = 150.  
    - Y = -4 (starting to return to original lane).
11. **T = 8 seconds:**  
    - X = 160.  
    - Y = -3 (continuing lane transition).
12. **T = 9 seconds:**  
    - X = 180.  
    - Y = -1 (nearing original lane).
13. **T = 10 seconds:**  
    - X = 200.  
    - Y = 0 (fully back in original lane).

### Summary of Critical Positions:
- T = 1: (20, -2)  
- T = 2: (40, -4)  
- T = 3: (60, -5)  
- T = 4: (80, -5)  
- T = 5: (100, -5)  
- T = 6: (120, -5)  
- T = 7: (140, -5)  
- T = 8: (160, -3)  
- T = 9: (180, -1)  
- T = 10: (200, 0)  

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction at X = 100 while maintaining a speed of 72 km/h and safely returns to the original lane.
