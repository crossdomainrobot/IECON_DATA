To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the maneuver into three phases: transitioning to the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction, and transitioning back to the original lane. We'll estimate the vehicle's position at 1-second intervals over the next 10 seconds.

### Given:
- **Starting Point:** (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Obstruction Location:** (X, Y) = (100, 0)
- **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate:** Y = -5
- **Initial Velocity:** 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum Speed:** 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- **Time Intervals:** T = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10 seconds

### Assumptions:
- The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
- The lane change is smooth and takes 2 seconds to complete (1 second to move to the adjacent lane and 1 second to return to the original lane).
- The vehicle starts the lane change at T = 2 seconds and completes it by T = 4 seconds.

### Route Planning:

1. **Phase 1: Traveling in the Original Lane (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)**
   - The vehicle continues in the original lane (Y = 0) at 20 m/s.
   - Positions:
     - T = 0: (0, 0)
     - T = 1: (20, 0)
     - T = 2: (40, 0)

2. **Phase 2: Transitioning to the Adjacent Lane (T = 2 to T = 4 seconds)**
   - The vehicle starts moving to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) at T = 2 seconds.
   - The lane change is completed by T = 4 seconds.
   - Positions:
     - T = 3: (60, -2.5)  (Halfway through the lane change)
     - T = 4: (80, -5)    (Fully in the adjacent lane)

3. **Phase 3: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 4 to T = 6 seconds)**
   - The vehicle continues in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) at 20 m/s.
   - Positions:
     - T = 5: (100, -5)   (Bypassing the obstruction at X = 100)
     - T = 6: (120, -5)

4. **Phase 4: Transitioning Back to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)**
   - The vehicle starts moving back to the original lane (Y = 0) at T = 6 seconds.
   - The lane change is completed by T = 8 seconds.
   - Positions:
     - T = 7: (140, -2.5)  (Halfway through the lane change)
     - T = 8: (160, 0)     (Fully in the original lane)

5. **Phase 5: Continuing in the Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds)**
   - The vehicle continues in the original lane (Y = 0) at 20 m/s.
   - Positions:
     - T = 9: (180, 0)
     - T = 10: (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions:
- T = 0: (0, 0)
- T = 1: (20, 0)
- T = 2: (40, 0)
- T = 3: (60, -2.5)
- T = 4: (80, -5)
- T = 5: (100, -5)
- T = 6: (120, -5)
- T = 7: (140, -2.5)
- T = 8: (160, 0)
- T = 9: (180, 0)
- T = 10: (200, 0)

This plan ensures that the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h and smoothly transitions between lanes.
