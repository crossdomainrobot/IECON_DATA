To navigate around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we need to plan the lane transitions carefully. Here¨s a step-by-step route planning with estimated vehicle positions at 1-second intervals:

### Assumptions:
- **Initial velocity**: 72 km/h (20 m/s).
- **Obstruction**: Located at (100, 0).
- **Adjacent lane**: Located at \( Y = -5 \).
- **Time starts at \( T = 0 \)**.

### Plan:
1. At \( T = 0 \), the vehicle is at (0, 0) in the outer lane.
2. Transition to the adjacent lane (\( Y = -5 \)) smoothly.
3. Bypass the obstruction at \( X = 100 \) while in the adjacent lane.
4. Return to the original lane (\( Y = 0 \)) after passing the obstruction.

### Calculations:
- **Distance traveled per second**: \( 20 \) meters (since speed is 20 m/s).
- **Lane transition time**: Assume 2 seconds to transition to the adjacent lane and 2 seconds to return to the original lane.

### Vehicle Positions at 1-second Intervals:
1. **\( T = 0 \)**: (0, 0) ！ Starting point.
2. **\( T = 1 \)**: (20, -1.25) ！ Begin transitioning to the adjacent lane.
3. **\( T = 2 \)**: (40, -2.5) ！ Continue transitioning to the adjacent lane.
4. **\( T = 3 \)**: (60, -5) ！ Fully in the adjacent lane.
5. **\( T = 4 \)**: (80, -5) ！ Continue in the adjacent lane.
6. **\( T = 5 \)**: (100, -5) ！ Bypass the obstruction at \( X = 100 \).
7. **\( T = 6 \)**: (120, -5) ！ Continue in the adjacent lane.
8. **\( T = 7 \)**: (140, -3.75) ！ Begin transitioning back to the original lane.
9. **\( T = 8 \)**: (160, -2.5) ！ Continue transitioning back to the original lane.
10. **\( T = 9 \)**: (180, -1.25) ！ Continue transitioning back to the original lane.
11. **\( T = 10 \)**: (200, 0) ！ Fully back in the original lane.

### Summary of Positions:
- \( T = 0 \): (0, 0)
- \( T = 1 \): (20, -1.25)
- \( T = 2 \): (40, -2.5)
- \( T = 3 \): (60, -5)
- \( T = 4 \): (80, -5)
- \( T = 5 \): (100, -5)
- \( T = 6 \): (120, -5)
- \( T = 7 \): (140, -3.75)
- \( T = 8 \): (160, -2.5)
- \( T = 9 \): (180, -1.25)
- \( T = 10 \): (200, 0)

This plan ensures that the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h and safely returns to the original lane.
