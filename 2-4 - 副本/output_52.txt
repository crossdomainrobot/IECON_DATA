To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:  
1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane** (from Y = 0 to Y = -5).  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction** (maintaining Y = -5 while X > 100).  
3. **Returning to the Original Lane** (from Y = -5 to Y = 0).  

### Assumptions:  
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).  
- Obstruction at X = 100 meters.  
- Time step: 1 second.  

### Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)  
We¡¯ll assume the lane change takes 2 seconds. During this time, the vehicle moves laterally from Y = 0 to Y = -5 while continuing to move forward at 20 m/s.  

- **T = 0 s**: (X, Y) = (0, 0).  
- **T = 1 s**: X = 20 m, Y = -2.5 m (halfway through the lane change).  
- **T = 2 s**: X = 40 m, Y = -5 m (fully in the adjacent lane).  

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6 seconds)  
The vehicle maintains Y = -5 while moving forward. The obstruction is at X = 100 m, so we¡¯ll ensure the vehicle passes this point.  

- **T = 3 s**: X = 60 m, Y = -5 m.  
- **T = 4 s**: X = 80 m, Y = -5 m.  
- **T = 5 s**: X = 100 m, Y = -5 m (reaches the obstruction).  
- **T = 6 s**: X = 120 m, Y = -5 m (fully bypasses the obstruction).  

### Phase 3: Returning to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)  
We¡¯ll assume the return lane change takes 2 seconds. During this time, the vehicle moves laterally from Y = -5 to Y = 0 while continuing to move forward at 20 m/s.  

- **T = 7 s**: X = 140 m, Y = -2.5 m (halfway through the return).  
- **T = 8 s**: X = 160 m, Y = 0 m (fully back in the original lane).  

### Final Positions (T = 9 to T = 10 seconds)  
The vehicle continues moving forward in the original lane.  

- **T = 9 s**: X = 180 m, Y = 0 m.  
- **T = 10 s**: X = 200 m, Y = 0 m.  

### Summary of Positions:  
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |  
| 2        | 40    | -5    |  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    |  
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |  
| 8        | 160   | 0     |  
| 9        | 180   | 0     |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |  

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
