To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the vehicle's movement into critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. We'll calculate the vehicle's position (X, Y) at each second, ensuring the speed remains above 60 km/h and the lane transitions are smooth.

### Given:
- **Initial position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Obstruction position**: (X, Y) = (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5
- **Initial velocity**: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- **Time intervals**: T = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10 seconds

### Assumptions:
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
2. The lane change is executed linearly over a short distance.
3. The obstruction is bypassed by moving into the adjacent lane (Y = -5) and then returning to the original lane (Y = 0).

### Route Planning:

#### Step 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)
- **Time**: T = 0 to T = 2 seconds
- **Distance traveled**: 20 m/s * 2 s = 40 m
- **Lateral movement**: From Y = 0 to Y = -5 (linear transition over 2 seconds)

#### Step 2: Bypass the Obstruction in the Adjacent Lane
- **Time**: T = 2 to T = 6 seconds
- **Distance traveled**: 20 m/s * 4 s = 80 m
- **Lateral position**: Y = -5 (constant)

#### Step 3: Lane Change Back to Original Lane (Y = 0)
- **Time**: T = 6 to T = 8 seconds
- **Distance traveled**: 20 m/s * 2 s = 40 m
- **Lateral movement**: From Y = -5 to Y = 0 (linear transition over 2 seconds)

#### Step 4: Continue in Original Lane
- **Time**: T = 8 to T = 10 seconds
- **Distance traveled**: 20 m/s * 2 s = 40 m
- **Lateral position**: Y = 0 (constant)

### Vehicle Positions at Critical Intervals:

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) | Description |
|----------|-------|-------|-------------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     | Starting position |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  | Lane change in progress |
| 2        | 40    | -5    | Fully in adjacent lane |
| 3        | 60    | -5    | Bypassing obstruction |
| 4        | 80    | -5    | Bypassing obstruction |
| 5        | 100   | -5    | Bypassing obstruction |
| 6        | 120   | -5    | Bypassing obstruction |
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  | Lane change back in progress |
| 8        | 160   | 0     | Fully back in original lane |
| 9        | 180   | 0     | Continuing in original lane |
| 10       | 200   | 0     | Continuing in original lane |

### Summary:
- **Lane change to adjacent lane**: Completed by T = 2 seconds.
- **Bypass obstruction**: Completed by T = 6 seconds.
- **Lane change back to original lane**: Completed by T = 8 seconds.
- **Continue in original lane**: From T = 8 to T = 10 seconds.

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h and safely navigates around the obstruction.
