To describe the trajectory of the vehicle as it switches lanes, passes the obstacle, and switches back, we¨ll assume the following:

1. The vehicle is initially at position (0, 0) in the right lane.
2. The obstacle is at position (100, 0).
3. The vehicle moves at a constant speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s).
4. The lane width is approximately 3.5 meters.
5. The lane change takes about 2 seconds to complete, during which the vehicle moves laterally at a constant rate.

### Step-by-Step Trajectory:

#### **Time T = 0 to T = 3 seconds (Approach and Lane Change):**
- At T = 0: Position = (0, 0) ！ Starting in the right lane.
- From T = 0 to T = 2: The vehicle begins switching to the left lane. The lateral position (Y) increases linearly from 0 to 3.5 meters over 2 seconds.
- At T = 1: Position = (20, 1.75) ！ Halfway through the lane change.
- At T = 2: Position = (40, 3.5) ！ Fully in the left lane.
- At T = 3: Position = (60, 3.5) ！ Continuing to move forward in the left lane.

#### **Time T = 4 to T = 6 seconds (Passing the Obstacle):**
- At T = 4: Position = (80, 3.5) ！ Moving past the obstacle in the left lane.
- At T = 5: Position = (100, 3.5) ！ Directly next to the obstacle.
- At T = 6: Position = (120, 3.5) ！ Clear of the obstacle.

#### **Time T = 7 to T = 9 seconds (Lane Change Back to Right Lane):**
- From T = 7 to T = 9: The vehicle begins switching back to the right lane. The lateral position (Y) decreases linearly from 3.5 to 0 meters over 2 seconds.
- At T = 7: Position = (140, 3.5) ！ Starting to move back to the right lane.
- At T = 8: Position = (160, 1.75) ！ Halfway through the lane change.
- At T = 9: Position = (180, 0) ！ Fully back in the right lane.

#### **Time T = 10 seconds (Continuing Forward):**
- At T = 10: Position = (200, 0) ！ Continuing to move forward in the right lane.

### Summary of Positions at Each Second:
- T = 0: (0, 0)
- T = 1: (20, 1.75)
- T = 2: (40, 3.5)
- T = 3: (60, 3.5)
- T = 4: (80, 3.5)
- T = 5: (100, 3.5)
- T = 6: (120, 3.5)
- T = 7: (140, 3.5)
- T = 8: (160, 1.75)
- T = 9: (180, 0)
- T = 10: (200, 0)

This trajectory ensures the vehicle safely passes the obstacle while maintaining a speed of 72 km/h and adheres to proper lane-changing maneuvers.
