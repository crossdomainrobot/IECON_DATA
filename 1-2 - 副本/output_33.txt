To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we need to account for the lane-changing maneuver while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h (which is approximately 16.67 m/s). Here's the step-by-step trajectory:

### Initial Conditions:
- Initial position: \( (0, 0) \)
- Speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- Obstacle position: \( (100, 0) \)
- Left lane is at \( Y = -3.5 \) meters (assuming standard lane width).

### Trajectory:
The vehicle will:
1. Maintain its speed in the right lane until it is close to the obstacle.
2. Gradually switch to the left lane.
3. Pass the obstacle while staying in the left lane.
4. Gradually switch back to the right lane.

Here¡¯s the position \( (X, Y) \) at each second:

#### T = 0 s:
- Position: \( (0, 0) \)
- Action: Moving straight in the right lane.

#### T = 1 s:
- Position: \( (20, 0) \)
- Action: Moving straight in the right lane.

#### T = 2 s:
- Position: \( (40, 0) \)
- Action: Moving straight in the right lane.

#### T = 3 s:
- Position: \( (60, 0) \)
- Action: Moving straight in the right lane.

#### T = 4 s:
- Position: \( (80, 0) \)
- Action: Begin transitioning to the left lane.

#### T = 5 s:
- Position: \( (100, -1.75) \)
- Action: Halfway into the left lane.

#### T = 6 s:
- Position: \( (120, -3.5) \)
- Action: Fully in the left lane, passing the obstacle.

#### T = 7 s:
- Position: \( (140, -3.5) \)
- Action: Continuing in the left lane.

#### T = 8 s:
- Position: \( (160, -3.5) \)
- Action: Continuing in the left lane.

#### T = 9 s:
- Position: \( (180, -1.75) \)
- Action: Begin transitioning back to the right lane.

#### T = 10 s:
- Position: \( (200, 0) \)
- Action: Fully back in the right lane.

### Summary:
The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver. It switches to the left lane between \( T = 4 \) s and \( T = 6 \) s, stays in the left lane until \( T = 9 \) s, and then transitions back to the right lane by \( T = 10 \) s. This ensures a smooth and safe lane-changing maneuver while avoiding the obstacle.
