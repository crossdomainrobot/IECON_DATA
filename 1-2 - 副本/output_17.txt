To plan the trajectory for the lane-changing maneuver, we'll break it down into phases: acceleration, lane change, passing the obstacle, and returning to the original lane. Here's the step-by-step trajectory:

---

### Assumptions:
1. Initial speed: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
2. Maintain a speed of at least 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.
3. Lane width: 3.5 meters (standard lane width).
4. Lane change duration: 3 seconds (smooth transition).
5. Passing distance: 20 meters ahead of the obstacle (safe clearance).

### Trajectory:

#### **Phase 1: Approaching the obstacle (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)**  
- Continue in the right lane, maintaining speed.  
- At T = 3 seconds, initiate the lane change.  

Positions:  
- T = 0: (0, 0)  
- T = 1: (20, 0)  
- T = 2: (40, 0)  
- T = 3: (60, 0)  

---

#### **Phase 2: Lane change (T = 3 to T = 6 seconds)**  
- Move laterally to the left lane while maintaining speed.  
- Complete the lane change by T = 6 seconds.  

Positions:  
- T = 4: (80, 1.17)  
- T = 5: (100, 2.33)  
- T = 6: (120, 3.5)  

---

#### **Phase 3: Passing the obstacle (T = 6 to T = 9 seconds)**  
- Stay in the left lane and pass the obstacle at (100, 0).  
- Ensure safe clearance by T = 9 seconds.  

Positions:  
- T = 7: (140, 3.5)  
- T = 8: (160, 3.5)  
- T = 9: (180, 3.5)  

---

#### **Phase 4: Returning to the right lane (T = 9 to T = 12 seconds)**  
- Initiate the lane change back to the right lane.  
- Complete the lane change by T = 12 seconds.  

Positions:  
- T = 10: (200, 2.33)  
- T = 11: (220, 1.17)  
- T = 12: (240, 0)

### Summary of Positions:
- T = 0: (0, 0)  
- T = 1: (20, 0)  
- T = 2: (40, 0)  
- T = 3: (60, 0)  
- T = 4: (80, 1.17)  
- T = 5: (100, 2.33)  
- T = 6: (120, 3.5)  
- T = 7: (140, 3.5)  
- T = 8: (160, 3.5)  
- T = 9: (180, 3.5)  
- T = 10: (200, 2.33)  
- T = 11: (220, 1.17)  
- T = 12: (240, 0)  

This trajectory ensures a smooth and safe lane-changing maneuver while maintaining highway speed.
