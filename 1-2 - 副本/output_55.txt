To describe the trajectory of the vehicle as it switches lanes to pass the obstacle and then switches back, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases: **lane change to the left**, **passing the obstacle**, and **lane change back to the right**. The vehicle¡¯s speed will be maintained at approximately 72 km/h (20 m/s) throughout the maneuver. Here¡¯s the trajectory in (X, Y) coordinates at each second:

---

### **Phase 1: Lane Change to the Left (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)**  
- **T = 0 s**: (0, 0)  
- **T = 1 s**: (20, -1)  
- **T = 2 s**: (40, -2)  
- **T = 3 s**: (60, -3)  

The vehicle moves laterally to the left lane over 3 seconds while continuing forward at 20 m/s.

---

### **Phase 2: Passing the Obstacle (T = 3 to T = 6 seconds)**  
- **T = 4 s**: (80, -3)  
- **T = 5 s**: (100, -3)  
- **T = 6 s**: (120, -3)  

The vehicle remains in the left lane and passes the obstacle, which is at (100, 0).

---

### **Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Right (T = 6 to T = 9 seconds)**  
- **T = 7 s**: (140, -2)  
- **T = 8 s**: (160, -1)  
- **T = 9 s**: (180, 0)  

The vehicle gradually moves back to the right lane over 3 seconds.

---

### **Final Position (T = 10 seconds)**  
- **T = 10 s**: (200, 0)  

The vehicle is fully back in the right lane and continues driving forward.

### Summary of Trajectory:  
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| 0        | (0, 0)          |  
| 1        | (20, -1)        |  
| 2        | (40, -2)        |  
| 3        | (60, -3)        |  
| 4        | (80, -3)        |  
| 5        | (100, -3)       |  
| 6        | (120, -3)       |  
| 7        | (140, -2)       |  
| 8        | (160, -1)       |  
| 9        | (180, 0)        |  
| 10       | (200, 0)        |  

This trajectory ensures the vehicle safely avoids the obstacle while maintaining a speed of 72 km/h.
