To describe the trajectory, we'll assume the vehicle moves at a constant speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) and completes the lane-changing maneuver smoothly. The obstacle is at (100, 0), and the left lane is at \( Y = -3.5 \) meters (assuming a standard lane width of 3.5 meters). Here's the trajectory:

### **Initial Conditions:**
- Speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- Initial position: (0, 0)
- Obstacle position: (100, 0)
- Left lane: \( Y = -3.5 \) meters

### **Trajectory:**

1. **T = 0 s**:  
   Position: (0, 0)  
   Action: Start moving forward in the right lane.

2. **T = 1 s**:  
   Position: (20, 0)  
   Action: Continue in the right lane.

3. **T = 2 s**:  
   Position: (40, 0)  
   Action: Continue in the right lane.

4. **T = 3 s**:  
   Position: (60, 0)  
   Action: Begin transitioning to the left lane.

5. **T = 4 s**:  
   Position: (80, -1.75)  
   Action: Continue transitioning to the left lane.

6. **T = 5 s**:  
   Position: (100, -3.5)  
   Action: Fully in the left lane, passing the obstacle.

7. **T = 6 s**:  
   Position: (120, -3.5)  
   Action: Continue in the left lane.

8. **T = 7 s**:  
   Position: (140, -3.5)  
   Action: Begin transitioning back to the right lane.

9. **T = 8 s**:  
   Position: (160, -1.75)  
   Action: Continue transitioning to the right lane.

10. **T = 9 s**:  
    Position: (180, 0)  
    Action: Fully back in the right lane.

11. **T = 10 s**:  
    Position: (200, 0)  
    Action: Continue in the right lane.

### **Explanation:**
- The vehicle moves forward at 20 m/s along the X-axis.
- Between T = 3 s and T = 5 s, the vehicle transitions to the left lane to avoid the obstacle at (100, 0).
- Between T = 7 s and T = 9 s, the vehicle transitions back to the right lane.
- The Y-coordinate changes smoothly to simulate a realistic lane change.
