To plan the trajectory for the lane-changing maneuver, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Initial Motion (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds):** Continue driving straight in the right lane at a speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s).
2. **Lane Change to the Left (T = 2 to T = 4 seconds):** Gradually move from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -3.5 meters, assuming a standard lane width of 3.5 meters).
3. **Passing the Obstacle (T = 4 to T = 6 seconds):** Drive straight in the left lane, passing the obstacle.
4. **Lane Change Back to the Right (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds):** Gradually move back from the left lane (Y = -3.5 meters) to the right lane (Y = 0).
5. **Continue Driving (T = 8 seconds and beyond):** Continue driving straight in the right lane.

Here¡¯s the trajectory in terms of (X, Y) positions at each second:

- **T = 0 seconds:** (0, 0)  
  The vehicle starts in the right lane.

- **T = 1 second:** (20, 0)  
  The vehicle continues straight in the right lane.

- **T = 2 seconds:** (40, 0)  
  The vehicle begins to prepare for the lane change.

- **T = 3 seconds:** (60, -1.75)  
  The vehicle is halfway through the lane change to the left lane.

- **T = 4 seconds:** (80, -3.5)  
  The vehicle is fully in the left lane.

- **T = 5 seconds:** (100, -3.5)  
  The vehicle is passing the obstacle in the left lane.

- **T = 6 seconds:** (120, -3.5)  
  The vehicle has passed the obstacle and prepares to return to the right lane.

- **T = 7 seconds:** (140, -1.75)  
  The vehicle is halfway through the lane change back to the right lane.

- **T = 8 seconds:** (160, 0)  
  The vehicle is fully back in the right lane.

- **T = 9 seconds:** (180, 0)  
  The vehicle continues straight in the right lane.

- **T = 10 seconds:** (200, 0)  
  The vehicle continues straight in the right lane.

### Notes:
- The lane change is assumed to take 2 seconds in each direction, with a smooth transition.
- The speed is maintained at 72 km/h (20 m/s) throughout the maneuver.
- The obstacle is passed safely in the left lane, and the vehicle returns to the right lane after clearing the obstacle.
