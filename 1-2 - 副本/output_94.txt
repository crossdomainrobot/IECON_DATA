To describe the vehicle's trajectory while performing the lane-changing maneuver, we＊ll break it down into three phases:

1. **Initial approach (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds):** Accelerate slightly to ensure a safe lane change and prepare to switch to the left lane.
2. **Lane change (T = 4 to T = 6 seconds):** Move laterally into the left lane while maintaining forward motion.
3. **Passing and returning (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds):** Pass the obstacle, then return to the right lane.

### Assumptions:
- Initial speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s).
- Target speed: Maintain above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).
- Lane width: Approximately 3.5 meters.
- Smooth lateral movement during lane change.

### Trajectory:
Here＊s the vehicle＊s position (X, Y) at each second:

- **T = 0 s:** (0, 0) 每 Starting position in the right lane.
- **T = 1 s:** (20, 0) 每 Moving forward at 20 m/s.
- **T = 2 s:** (40, 0) 每 Continuing in the right lane.
- **T = 3 s:** (60, 0) 每 Preparing for lane change.
- **T = 4 s:** (80, -1.2) 每 Beginning lateral movement into the left lane.
- **T = 5 s:** (100, -2.4) 每 Halfway into the left lane.
- **T = 6 s:** (120, -3.5) 每 Fully in the left lane, passing the obstacle.
- **T = 7 s:** (140, -3.5) 每 Continuing in the left lane past the obstacle.
- **T = 8 s:** (160, -2.4) 每 Beginning to return to the right lane.
- **T = 9 s:** (180, -1.2) 每 Halfway back into the right lane.
- **T = 10 s:** (200, 0) 每 Fully back in the right lane.

### Explanation:
- The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
- The lateral movement (Y) is smooth, taking 3 seconds to complete each lane change (left and right).
- The obstacle is passed safely in the left lane between T = 6 s and T = 7 s.
- By T = 10 s, the vehicle has returned to the right lane and continues forward.

This trajectory ensures the vehicle maintains a safe speed and smoothly navigates around the obstacle.
