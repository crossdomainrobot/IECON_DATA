To plan the trajectory for the lane-changing maneuver, we'll break it down into phases:

1. **Approach the obstacle**: Maintain speed in the right lane.
2. **Change to the left lane**: Smoothly transition from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -3.5 meters, assuming a standard lane width).
3. **Pass the obstacle**: Stay in the left lane while overtaking the obstacle.
4. **Return to the right lane**: Smoothly transition back to the right lane.

### Assumptions:
- Initial speed: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
- Lane width: 3.5 meters.
- Lane change duration: 3 seconds (smooth transition).
- Obstacle is at (100, 0), and we start at (0, 0).
- Maintain speed at ~20 m/s (72 km/h).

### Trajectory Plan:
We'll describe the position (X, Y) at each second (T = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10).

#### **Phase 1: Approach the obstacle (T = 0 to T = 3)**
- Stay in the right lane (Y = 0).
- Move forward at 20 m/s.

| Time (T) | X Position | Y Position |
|----------|------------|------------|
| 0        | 0          | 0          |
| 1        | 20         | 0          |
| 2        | 40         | 0          |
| 3        | 60         | 0          |

#### **Phase 2: Change to the left lane (T = 4 to T = 6)**
- Smoothly transition from Y = 0 to Y = -3.5 meters over 3 seconds.
- Continue moving forward at 20 m/s.

| Time (T) | X Position | Y Position |
|----------|------------|------------|
| 4        | 80         | -1.17      |
| 5        | 100        | -2.33      |
| 6        | 120        | -3.5       |

#### **Phase 3: Pass the obstacle (T = 7 to T = 8)**
- Stay in the left lane (Y = -3.5 meters).
- Continue moving forward at 20 m/s.

| Time (T) | X Position | Y Position |
|----------|------------|------------|
| 7        | 140        | -3.5       |
| 8        | 160        | -3.5       |

#### **Phase 4: Return to the right lane (T = 9 to T = 10)**
- Smoothly transition from Y = -3.5 meters to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.
- Continue moving forward at 20 m/s.

| Time (T) | X Position | Y Position |
|----------|------------|------------|
| 9        | 180        | -1.75      |
| 10       | 200        | 0          |

### Summary:
At T = 10 seconds, the vehicle has successfully passed the obstacle and returned to the right lane. The trajectory ensures the vehicle stays above 60 km/h and completes the maneuver safely.
