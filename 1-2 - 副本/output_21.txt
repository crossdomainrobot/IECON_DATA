To describe the trajectory, we need to break the maneuver into phases: **1) Lane change to the left, 2) Passing the obstacle, and 3) Lane change back to the right**. Here¡¯s a step-by-step plan:

### **Assumptions**:
- **Initial speed**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s (constant speed assumed for simplicity).
- **Lane width**: Assume each lane is 3.5 meters wide, so the lateral shift from right to left lane is 3.5 meters.
- **Lane change time**: Assume 2 seconds for each lane change (smooth and safe).
- **Passing time**: Assume it takes 4 seconds to pass the obstacle completely.

### **Trajectory Calculation**:

#### **1. Lane Change to the Left (T = 0 to T = 2)**:
- **Lateral motion**: Move from Y = 0 (right lane) to Y = 3.5 (left lane) over 2 seconds.
- **Longitudinal motion**: Continue moving forward at 20 m/s.
- **Positions**:
  - T = 0: (0, 0)
  - T = 1: (20, 1.75)
  - T = 2: (40, 3.5)

#### **2. Passing the Obstacle (T = 2 to T = 6)**:
- **Lateral motion**: Stay in the left lane (Y = 3.5).
- **Longitudinal motion**: Continue moving forward at 20 m/s.
- **Positions**:
  - T = 3: (60, 3.5)
  - T = 4: (80, 3.5)
  - T = 5: (100, 3.5)
  - T = 6: (120, 3.5)

#### **3. Lane Change Back to the Right (T = 6 to T = 8)**:
- **Lateral motion**: Move from Y = 3.5 (left lane) to Y = 0 (right lane) over 2 seconds.
- **Longitudinal motion**: Continue moving forward at 20 m/s.
- **Positions**:
  - T = 7: (140, 1.75)
  - T = 8: (160, 0)

### **Final Trajectory**:
| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|-----------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, 1.75)      |
| 2        | (40, 3.5)       |
| 3        | (60, 3.5)       |
| 4        | (80, 3.5)       |
| 5        | (100, 3.5)      |
| 6        | (120, 3.5)      |
| 7        | (140, 1.75)     |
| 8        | (160, 0)        |

### **Notes**:
- The vehicle completes the maneuver in 8 seconds.
- The speed remains constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h).
- The trajectory ensures the obstacle is safely passed while maintaining highway speed.
