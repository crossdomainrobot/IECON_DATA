To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:  
1. **Lane change to the left lane** (from right lane to left lane).  
2. **Passing the obstacle** (driving past the obstacle in the left lane).  
3. **Lane change back to the right lane** (returning to the right lane after passing the obstacle).  

### Assumptions:  
- The vehicle¡¯s initial speed is **72 km/h (20 m/s)**.  
- The obstacle is at **(100, 0)**.  
- The left lane is at **Y = -3 meters** (assuming a standard lane width of 3 meters).  
- The lane change takes **3 seconds** to complete smoothly.  
- The vehicle maintains a speed of **20 m/s** throughout the maneuver.  

### Trajectory:  
Let¡¯s describe the vehicle¡¯s position **(X, Y)** at each second (T = 1, 2, 3, etc.).  

#### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Left Lane (T = 0 to T = 3)  
- The vehicle moves laterally from **Y = 0** to **Y = -3** over 3 seconds.  
- The longitudinal position **X** increases at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m)        | Y (m)       |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| T = 0    | 0            | 0           |
| T = 1    | 20           | -1          |
| T = 2    | 40           | -2          |
| T = 3    | 60           | -3          |

#### Phase 2: Passing the Obstacle (T = 4 to T = 7)  
- The vehicle continues in the left lane (**Y = -3**) while passing the obstacle.  

| Time (s) | X (m)        | Y (m)       |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| T = 4    | 80           | -3          |
| T = 5    | 100          | -3          |
| T = 6    | 120          | -3          |
| T = 7    | 140          | -3          |

#### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Right Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)  
- The vehicle moves laterally from **Y = -3** to **Y = 0** over 3 seconds.  

| Time (s) | X (m)        | Y (m)       |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| T = 8    | 160          | -2          |
| T = 9    | 180          | -1          |
| T = 10   | 200          | 0           |

### Summary:  
The vehicle completes the lane-changing maneuver and passes the obstacle by **T = 10 seconds**. It remains in the left lane from **T = 3** to **T = 7** to safely pass the obstacle. The speed is maintained at **20 m/s (72 km/h)** throughout the maneuver.
