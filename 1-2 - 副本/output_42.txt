To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we¡¯ll break it down into three phases:  
1. **Lane Change to the Left Lane** (from right lane to left lane).  
2. **Passing the Obstacle** (staying in the left lane).  
3. **Lane Change Back to the Right Lane** (from left lane to right lane).  

We¡¯ll assume the following:  
- The vehicle maintains a speed of **72 km/h (20 m/s)**.  
- Each lane change takes **3 seconds** to complete.  
- The left lane is **3.5 meters** to the left of the right lane (Y = 0).  
- The obstacle is at (100, 0), and we start at (0, 0).  

### Trajectory Plan:  
1. **Lane Change to the Left Lane (T = 0 to T = 3):**  
   - Move from Y = 0 to Y = -3.5 (left lane).  
   - X increases linearly at 20 m/s.  

2. **Passing the Obstacle (T = 3 to T = 7):**  
   - Stay in the left lane (Y = -3.5).  
   - X increases linearly at 20 m/s.  

3. **Lane Change Back to the Right Lane (T = 7 to T = 10):**  
   - Move from Y = -3.5 to Y = 0 (right lane).  
   - X increases linearly at 20 m/s.  

### Trajectory (X, Y) at Each Second:  
- **T = 0:** (0, 0)  
- **T = 1:** (20, -1.17)  
- **T = 2:** (40, -2.33)  
- **T = 3:** (60, -3.5)  
- **T = 4:** (80, -3.5)  
- **T = 5:** (100, -3.5)  
- **T = 6:** (120, -3.5)  
- **T = 7:** (140, -3.5)  
- **T = 8:** (160, -2.33)  
- **T = 9:** (180, -1.17)  
- **T = 10:** (200, 0)  

### Explanation:  
- **Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 3):**  
  - Y changes linearly from 0 to -3.5 over 3 seconds.  
  - X increases by 20 meters each second.  

- **Passing the Obstacle (T = 3 to T = 7):**  
  - Y remains constant at -3.5 (left lane).  
  - X increases by 20 meters each second.  

- **Lane Change Back (T = 7 to T = 10):**  
  - Y changes linearly from -3.5 to 0 over 3 seconds.  
  - X increases by 20 meters each second.  

This trajectory ensures the vehicle maintains a speed of 72 km/h, stays in the left lane while passing the obstacle, and safely returns to the right lane.
