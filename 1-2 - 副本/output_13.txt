To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we¡¯ll break it down into three phases:  
1. **Lane change to the left lane**  
2. **Passing the obstacle**  
3. **Lane change back to the right lane**  

### Assumptions:  
- Initial speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s)  
- Maintain speed above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)  
- Lane width: 3.5 meters (Y = 0 for the right lane, Y = -3.5 for the left lane)  
- Smooth lane change over 3 seconds  

### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Left Lane (T = 0 to T = 3)  
At T = 0, the vehicle is at (0, 0). The lane change will be completed by T = 3, reaching Y = -3.5.  

#### Trajectory:  
- T = 1: (20, -1.17)  
- T = 2: (40, -2.33)  
- T = 3: (60, -3.5)  

### Phase 2: Passing the Obstacle (T = 3 to T = 7)  
The vehicle continues in the left lane, passing the obstacle at X = 100.  

#### Trajectory:  
- T = 4: (80, -3.5)  
- T = 5: (100, -3.5)  
- T = 6: (120, -3.5)  
- T = 7: (140, -3.5)  

### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Right Lane (T = 7 to T = 10)  
The vehicle changes back to the right lane, completing the maneuver by T = 10.  

#### Trajectory:  
- T = 8: (160, -2.33)  
- T = 9: (180, -1.17)  
- T = 10: (200, 0)  

### Summary of Positions:  
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| 0        | (0, 0)          |  
| 1        | (20, -1.17)     |  
| 2        | (40, -2.33)     |  
| 3        | (60, -3.5)      |  
| 4        | (80, -3.5)      |  
| 5        | (100, -3.5)     |  
| 6        | (120, -3.5)     |  
| 7        | (140, -3.5)     |  
| 8        | (160, -2.33)    |  
| 9        | (180, -1.17)    |  
| 10       | (200, 0)        |  

This trajectory ensures the vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h), stays in the left lane while passing the obstacle, and smoothly returns to the right lane.
