To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we'll break down the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Left Lane**: The vehicle moves from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -3.5 meters, assuming a standard lane width of 3.5 meters).
2. **Passing the Obstacle**: The vehicle continues in the left lane, maintaining a speed of at least 60 km/h.
3. **Lane Change Back to the Right Lane**: After passing the obstacle, the vehicle moves back to the right lane (Y = 0).

Let's assume the vehicle maintains a constant speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) throughout the maneuver. The lane change takes about 3 seconds each way (to and from the left lane).

### Trajectory Calculation:

- **Time T = 0 s**: Initial position (X, Y) = (0, 0).
- **Time T = 1 s**: Vehicle starts moving to the left. Position (X, Y) = (20, -0.6).
- **Time T = 2 s**: Vehicle continues moving to the left. Position (X, Y) = (40, -1.2).
- **Time T = 3 s**: Vehicle completes the lane change to the left lane. Position (X, Y) = (60, -3.5).
- **Time T = 4 s**: Vehicle continues in the left lane. Position (X, Y) = (80, -3.5).
- **Time T = 5 s**: Vehicle continues in the left lane, passing the obstacle. Position (X, Y) = (100, -3.5).
- **Time T = 6 s**: Vehicle starts moving back to the right lane. Position (X, Y) = (120, -2.9).
- **Time T = 7 s**: Vehicle continues moving to the right. Position (X, Y) = (140, -2.3).
- **Time T = 8 s**: Vehicle completes the lane change back to the right lane. Position (X, Y) = (160, 0).
- **Time T = 9 s**: Vehicle continues in the right lane. Position (X, Y) = (180, 0).
- **Time T = 10 s**: Vehicle continues in the right lane. Position (X, Y) = (200, 0).

### Summary of Positions:

- T = 0 s: (0, 0)
- T = 1 s: (20, -0.6)
- T = 2 s: (40, -1.2)
- T = 3 s: (60, -3.5)
- T = 4 s: (80, -3.5)
- T = 5 s: (100, -3.5)
- T = 6 s: (120, -2.9)
- T = 7 s: (140, -2.3)
- T = 8 s: (160, 0)
- T = 9 s: (180, 0)
- T = 10 s: (200, 0)

This trajectory ensures that the vehicle maintains a speed of 72 km/h, successfully changes lanes to pass the obstacle, and returns to the right lane safely.
