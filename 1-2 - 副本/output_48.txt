To plan the trajectory, we'll break the maneuver into three phases: **1) Lane change to the left**, **2) Passing the obstacle**, and **3) Lane change back to the right**. We'll assume smooth transitions and constant speed during the maneuver.

### Assumptions:
- Initial speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s).
- Maintain speed above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).
- Lane width: 3.5 meters (standard for highways).
- Lane change takes 2 seconds (smooth transition).
- Time step: 1 second.

### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Left (T = 0 to T = 2)
- The vehicle moves from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -3.5 m) over 2 seconds.
- Speed remains constant at 20 m/s.

### Phase 2: Passing the Obstacle (T = 2 to T = 6)
- The vehicle continues in the left lane, passing the obstacle at X = 100 m.
- Speed remains constant at 20 m/s.

### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Right (T = 6 to T = 8)
- The vehicle moves from the left lane (Y = -3.5 m) back to the right lane (Y = 0) over 2 seconds.
- Speed remains constant at 20 m/s.

### Trajectory:
Here¡¯s the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at each second:

#### T = 0: (0, 0)
- Starting position in the right lane.

#### T = 1: (20, -1.75)
- Halfway through the lane change to the left.

#### T = 2: (40, -3.5)
- Fully in the left lane, beginning to pass the obstacle.

#### T = 3: (60, -3.5)
- Continuing in the left lane.

#### T = 4: (80, -3.5)
- Approaching the obstacle.

#### T = 5: (100, -3.5)
- Passing the obstacle.

#### T = 6: (120, -3.5)
- Fully past the obstacle, starting to return to the right lane.

#### T = 7: (140, -1.75)
- Halfway through the lane change back to the right.

#### T = 8: (160, 0)
- Fully back in the right lane, maneuver complete.

#### T = 9: (180, 0)
- Continuing in the right lane.

#### T = 10: (200, 0)
- Continuing in the right lane.

### Summary:
The vehicle completes the lane-changing maneuver by T = 8 seconds, having safely passed the obstacle and returned to the right lane. After T = 8, it continues traveling straight in the right lane.
