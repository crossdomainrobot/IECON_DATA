To describe the vehicle's trajectory for the lane-changing maneuver, we'll break it into phases: **acceleration**, **lane change**, **passing the obstacle**, and **returning to the right lane**. The initial speed is 72 km/h (20 m/s), and we'll maintain a speed of at least 60 km/h (16.67 m/s). Here's the trajectory in (X, Y) coordinates at 1-second intervals:

---

### **Phase 1: Acceleration (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)**  
- Accelerate slightly to ensure smooth lane change.  
- Speed increases from 20 m/s to 22 m/s.  
- **Positions**:  
  - T = 0: (0, 0)  
  - T = 1: (20, 0)  
  - T = 2: (42, 0)  

---

### **Phase 2: Lane Change (T = 2 to T = 4 seconds)**  
- Move laterally to the left lane. Assume the lane width is 3 meters, so Y changes from 0 to -3.  
- Maintain speed at 22 m/s.  
- **Positions**:  
  - T = 3: (64, -1.5)  
  - T = 4: (86, -3)  

---

### **Phase 3: Passing the Obstacle (T = 4 to T = 6 seconds)**  
- Continue in the left lane past the obstacle at (100, 0).  
- Maintain speed at 22 m/s.  
- **Positions**:  
  - T = 5: (108, -3)  
  - T = 6: (130, -3)  

---

### **Phase 4: Returning to the Right Lane (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)**  
- Move laterally back to the right lane (Y changes from -3 to 0).  
- Maintain speed at 22 m/s.  
- **Positions**:  
  - T = 7: (152, -1.5)  
  - T = 8: (174, 0)  

---

### **Phase 5: Continuing in the Right Lane (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds)**  
- Continue driving in the right lane.  
- Maintain speed at 22 m/s.  
- **Positions**:  
  - T = 9: (196, 0)  
  - T = 10: (218, 0)

### **Summary of Positions (X, Y) at Each Second**:  
| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| 0        | (0, 0)          |  
| 1        | (20, 0)         |  
| 2        | (42, 0)         |  
| 3        | (64, -1.5)      |  
| 4        | (86, -3)        |  
| 5        | (108, -3)       |  
| 6        | (130, -3)       |  
| 7        | (152, -1.5)     |  
| 8        | (174, 0)        |  
| 9        | (196, 0)        |  
| 10       | (218, 0)        |

This trajectory ensures the vehicle safely changes lanes, passes the obstacle, and returns to the right lane while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
