To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we¡¯ll break down the maneuver into three phases: **lane change to the left**, **passing the obstacle**, and **lane change back to the right**. We¡¯ll assume the vehicle maintains a constant speed of **72 km/h (20 m/s)** and completes each lane change in **3 seconds**. The obstacle is at **(100, 0)**, and the left lane is at **Y = -3 meters** (assuming a lane width of 3 meters).

Here¡¯s the trajectory:

### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Left (T = 0 to T = 3)
- At **T = 0**: (0, 0)  
- At **T = 1**: (20, -1)  
- At **T = 2**: (40, -2)  
- At **T = 3**: (60, -3)  

### Phase 2: Passing the Obstacle (T = 3 to T = 6)
- At **T = 4**: (80, -3)  
- At **T = 5**: (100, -3)  
- At **T = 6**: (120, -3)  

### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Right (T = 6 to T = 9)
- At **T = 7**: (140, -2)  
- At **T = 8**: (160, -1)  
- At **T = 9**: (180, 0)  

### Final Position (T = 10)
- At **T = 10**: (200, 0)  

### Summary of Positions:
- T = 0: (0, 0)  
- T = 1: (20, -1)  
- T = 2: (40, -2)  
- T = 3: (60, -3)  
- T = 4: (80, -3)  
- T = 5: (100, -3)  
- T = 6: (120, -3)  
- T = 7: (140, -2)  
- T = 8: (160, -1)  
- T = 9: (180, 0)  
- T = 10: (200, 0)  

This trajectory ensures the vehicle maintains a speed of **72 km/h**, smoothly changes lanes, passes the obstacle safely, and returns to the original lane.
