Here＊s a trajectory for your lane-changing maneuver, assuming a smooth and safe transition. The initial speed is 72 km/h (20 m/s), and we＊ll maintain a speed of 60 km/h (16.67 m/s) or higher during the maneuver. The left lane is at \( Y = -3 \) meters (assuming a standard lane width of 3 meters).

### Trajectory:
- **T = 0 s**: Initial position \((0, 0)\).  
  Vehicle is in the right lane, traveling at 20 m/s.

- **T = 1 s**: \((20, 0)\).  
  Vehicle continues in the right lane.

- **T = 2 s**: \((40, 0)\).  
  Vehicle continues in the right lane.

- **T = 3 s**: \((60, -1)\).  
  Begin transitioning to the left lane. Lateral movement starts.

- **T = 4 s**: \((80, -2)\).  
  Continue transitioning to the left lane.

- **T = 5 s**: \((100, -3)\).  
  Fully in the left lane, passing the obstacle at \( X = 100 \).

- **T = 6 s**: \((120, -3)\).  
  Continue in the left lane, maintaining speed.

- **T = 7 s**: \((140, -3)\).  
  Continue in the left lane.

- **T = 8 s**: \((160, -2)\).  
  Begin transitioning back to the right lane.

- **T = 9 s**: \((180, -1)\).  
  Continue transitioning back to the right lane.

- **T = 10 s**: \((200, 0)\).  
  Fully back in the right lane, maneuver complete.

### Explanation:
1. **Lane Change Preparation (T = 0每2 s)**: Vehicle stays in the right lane to approach the obstacle.
2. **Lane Change Execution (T = 3每5 s)**: Smoothly transitions to the left lane to avoid the obstacle.
3. **Passing the Obstacle (T = 5每7 s)**: Stays in the left lane while passing the obstacle.
4. **Returning to the Right Lane (T = 8每10 s)**: Smoothly transitions back to the right lane after passing the obstacle.

This trajectory ensures the vehicle maintains a safe speed and completes the lane-changing maneuver efficiently.
