To describe the trajectory of the vehicle as it switches lanes, passes the obstacle, and switches back, we¨ll break the maneuver into phases:

1. **Initial phase (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)**: The vehicle continues in the right lane at its initial speed (72 km/h or 20 m/s).  
2. **Lane change phase (T = 2 to T = 4 seconds)**: The vehicle smoothly moves into the left lane.  
3. **Passing phase (T = 4 to T = 6 seconds)**: The vehicle maintains its speed in the left lane, passing the obstacle.  
4. **Return phase (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)**: The vehicle smoothly returns to the right lane.  
5. **Final phase (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds)**: The vehicle continues in the right lane at its initial speed.

Here¨s the trajectory in (X, Y) coordinates at each second:

### Assumptions:
- The vehicle¨s speed is constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h).  
- The lateral movement (Y) is smooth and linear during lane changes.  
- The left lane is at Y = -4 meters (relative to the right lane at Y = 0).  

### Trajectory:
- **T = 0 s**: (0, 0) ！ Initial position.  
- **T = 1 s**: (20, 0) ！ Continuing in the right lane.  
- **T = 2 s**: (40, 0) ！ Preparing to change lanes.  
- **T = 3 s**: (60, -2) ！ Midway through lane change.  
- **T = 4 s**: (80, -4) ！ Fully in the left lane.  
- **T = 5 s**: (100, -4) ！ Passing the obstacle in the left lane.  
- **T = 6 s**: (120, -4) ！ Preparing to return to the right lane.  
- **T = 7 s**: (140, -2) ！ Midway through returning to the right lane.  
- **T = 8 s**: (160, 0) ！ Fully back in the right lane.  
- **T = 9 s**: (180, 0) ！ Continuing in the right lane.  
- **T = 10 s**: (200, 0) ！ Continuing in the right lane.  

### Explanation:
- The vehicle moves 20 meters per second in the X direction due to its speed of 72 km/h.  
- The lane change is modeled as a linear transition in the Y direction over 2 seconds.  
- The obstacle at (100, 0) is passed while the vehicle is in the left lane (Y = -4).  
- After passing, the vehicle returns to the right lane (Y = 0) smoothly.  

This trajectory ensures the vehicle maintains a safe speed and completes the maneuver efficiently.
