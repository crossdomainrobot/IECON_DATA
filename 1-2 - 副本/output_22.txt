To plan the trajectory for the lane-changing maneuver, we¡¯ll break it down into steps:

1. **Initial Motion (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds):**  
   - Continue driving straight in the right lane at 72 km/h (20 m/s).  
   - Position at T = 1: (20, 0)  
   - Position at T = 2: (40, 0)  

2. **Start Lane Change (T = 2 to T = 4 seconds):**  
   - Begin moving laterally to the left lane while maintaining speed.  
   - Position at T = 3: (60, -1.5) (assuming smooth lateral movement)  
   - Position at T = 4: (80, -3) (fully in the left lane)  

3. **Passing the Obstacle (T = 4 to T = 6 seconds):**  
   - Continue driving straight in the left lane, passing the obstacle at (100, 0).  
   - Position at T = 5: (100, -3)  
   - Position at T = 6: (120, -3)  

4. **Returning to the Right Lane (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds):**  
   - Begin moving laterally back to the right lane.  
   - Position at T = 7: (140, -1.5)  
   - Position at T = 8: (160, 0) (fully in the right lane)  

5. **Continue Driving (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds):**  
   - Drive straight in the right lane.  
   - Position at T = 9: (180, 0)  
   - Position at T = 10: (200, 0)  

### Summary of Positions:
- T = 0: (0, 0)  
- T = 1: (20, 0)  
- T = 2: (40, 0)  
- T = 3: (60, -1.5)  
- T = 4: (80, -3)  
- T = 5: (100, -3)  
- T = 6: (120, -3)  
- T = 7: (140, -1.5)  
- T = 8: (160, 0)  
- T = 9: (180, 0)  
- T = 10: (200, 0)  

This trajectory ensures the vehicle stays above 60 km/h, smoothly changes lanes, passes the obstacle, and returns to the right lane safely.
