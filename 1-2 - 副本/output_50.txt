To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we¡¯ll break it down into three phases: **initial driving**, **lane change**, and **return to the right lane**. The vehicle¡¯s speed is maintained at approximately 72 km/h (20 m/s), and we¡¯ll ensure the maneuver is completed smoothly and safely.

### Assumptions:
1. **Initial Position**: (0, 0) at T = 0.
2. **Obstacle Position**: (100, 0).
3. **Lane Width**: Assume each lane is 3.5 meters wide, so the left lane is centered at Y = -3.5 meters.
4. **Lane Change Duration**: Assume it takes 3 seconds to complete a lane change.
5. **Time Steps**: We¡¯ll calculate the position every second.

### Trajectory:

#### Phase 1: Initial Driving (T = 0 to T = 4)
- The vehicle travels straight in the right lane toward the obstacle.
- **Position at T = 1**: \( X = 20 \times 1 = 20 \), \( Y = 0 \) ¡ú (20, 0)  
- **Position at T = 2**: \( X = 20 \times 2 = 40 \), \( Y = 0 \) ¡ú (40, 0)  
- **Position at T = 3**: \( X = 20 \times 3 = 60 \), \( Y = 0 \) ¡ú (60, 0)  
- **Position at T = 4**: \( X = 20 \times 4 = 80 \), \( Y = 0 \) ¡ú (80, 0)  

At T = 4, the vehicle is 20 meters away from the obstacle and begins the lane change.

#### Phase 2: Lane Change (T = 4 to T = 7)
- The vehicle moves laterally to the left lane while continuing to move forward.
- Lateral movement: \( Y \) changes from 0 to -3.5 meters over 3 seconds.
- **Position at T = 5**: \( X = 20 \times 5 = 100 \), \( Y = -1.17 \) ¡ú (100, -1.17)  
- **Position at T = 6**: \( X = 20 \times 6 = 120 \), \( Y = -2.33 \) ¡ú (120, -2.33)  
- **Position at T = 7**: \( X = 20 \times 7 = 140 \), \( Y = -3.5 \) ¡ú (140, -3.5)  

At T = 7, the vehicle is fully in the left lane and has passed the obstacle.

#### Phase 3: Return to Right Lane (T = 7 to T = 10)
- The vehicle moves laterally back to the right lane while continuing to move forward.
- Lateral movement: \( Y \) changes from -3.5 to 0 meters over 3 seconds.
- **Position at T = 8**: \( X = 20 \times 8 = 160 \), \( Y = -2.33 \) ¡ú (160, -2.33)  
- **Position at T = 9**: \( X = 20 \times 9 = 180 \), \( Y = -1.17 \) ¡ú (180, -1.17)  
- **Position at T = 10**: \( X = 20 \times 10 = 200 \), \( Y = 0 \) ¡ú (200, 0)  

At T = 10, the vehicle is back in the right lane, and the maneuver is complete.

### Summary of Positions:
- T = 1: (20, 0)  
- T = 2: (40, 0)  
- T = 3: (60, 0)  
- T = 4: (80, 0)  
- T = 5: (100, -1.17)  
- T = 6: (120, -2.33)  
- T = 7: (140, -3.5)  
- T = 8: (160, -2.33)  
- T = 9: (180, -1.17)  
- T = 10: (200, 0)  

This trajectory ensures the vehicle maintains a speed of 72 km/h, safely switches lanes, and avoids the obstacle.
