To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we¡¯ll break it down into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Left Lane**: The vehicle moves from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -3.5 meters, assuming a standard lane width of 3.5 meters).
2. **Passing the Obstacle**: The vehicle continues in the left lane, maintaining a speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s), until it has passed the obstacle.
3. **Lane Change Back to the Right Lane**: The vehicle moves back to the right lane (Y = 0).

We¡¯ll assume the lane change takes approximately 2 seconds each (to the left and back to the right). Here¡¯s the trajectory:

### **Trajectory**
- **Initial Position**: (0, 0) at T = 0
- **Speed**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change to the Left Lane (T = 0 to T = 2)**
- At T = 1: (20, -1.75)  
  (Halfway through the lane change, Y is halfway to -3.5 meters)
- At T = 2: (40, -3.5)  
  (Lane change complete, now fully in the left lane)

#### **Phase 2: Passing the Obstacle (T = 2 to T = 6)**
- At T = 3: (60, -3.5)  
- At T = 4: (80, -3.5)  
- At T = 5: (100, -3.5)  
  (Passing the obstacle at X = 100 meters)
- At T = 6: (120, -3.5)  
  (Fully past the obstacle)

#### **Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Right Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)**
- At T = 7: (140, -1.75)  
  (Halfway back to the right lane)
- At T = 8: (160, 0)  
  (Lane change complete, back in the right lane)

#### **Phase 4: Continue in the Right Lane (T = 8 onwards)**
- At T = 9: (180, 0)  
- At T = 10: (200, 0)

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|-----------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -1.75)     |

| 3        | (60, -3.5)      |
| 4        | (80, -3.5)      |
| 5        | (100, -3.5)     |
| 6        | (120, -3.5)     |
| 7        | (140, -1.75)    |
| 8        | (160, 0)        |
| 9        | (180, 0)        |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

This trajectory ensures the vehicle passes the obstacle safely while maintaining a speed of 72 km/h and completes the lane-changing maneuver within 10 seconds.
