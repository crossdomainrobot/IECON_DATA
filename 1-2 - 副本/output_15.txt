To describe the trajectory of the vehicle over the next 10 seconds, we need to account for the lane-changing maneuver while maintaining a speed of over 60 km/h. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the vehicle's position at each second:

### Assumptions:
- **Initial speed**: 72 km/h (20 m/s).
- **Lane width**: Assume a standard lane width of 3.5 meters.
- **Lane-changing duration**: Approximately 3 seconds to move from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = 3.5).
- **Obstacle position**: (100, 0).

### Trajectory:
1. **T = 0s**: Initial position is (0, 0). The vehicle is in the right lane.
2. **T = 1s**: The vehicle starts moving left. Position: (20, 1.17) 「 (20, 1.2).
3. **T = 2s**: Continuing the lane change. Position: (40, 2.33) 「 (40, 2.3).
4. **T = 3s**: Completing the lane change. Position: (60, 3.5). The vehicle is now fully in the left lane.
5. **T = 4s**: Maintaining speed in the left lane. Position: (80, 3.5).
6. **T = 5s**: Passing the obstacle at (100, 0). Position: (100, 3.5).
7. **T = 6s**: Continuing in the left lane. Position: (120, 3.5).
8. **T = 7s**: Starting to move back to the right lane. Position: (140, 2.33) 「 (140, 2.3).
9. **T = 8s**: Continuing the lane change. Position: (160, 1.17) 「 (160, 1.2).
10. **T = 9s**: Completing the lane change. Position: (180, 0). The vehicle is now fully in the right lane.
11. **T = 10s**: Continuing in the right lane. Position: (200, 0).

### Summary of Positions:
- **T = 0s**: (0, 0)
- **T = 1s**: (20, 1.2)
- **T = 2s**: (40, 2.3)
- **T = 3s**: (60, 3.5)
- **T = 4s**: (80, 3.5)
- **T = 5s**: (100, 3.5)
- **T = 6s**: (120, 3.5)
- **T = 7s**: (140, 2.3)
- **T = 8s**: (160, 1.2)
- **T = 9s**: (180, 0)
- **T = 10s**: (200, 0)

This trajectory ensures that the vehicle safely passes the obstacle while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h and adheres to the lane-changing maneuver.
