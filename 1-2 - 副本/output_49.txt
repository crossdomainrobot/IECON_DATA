To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we need to account for the lane-changing maneuver while maintaining a speed of over 60 km/h (16.67 m/s). Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the vehicle's position (X, Y) over time (T):

### Assumptions:
- **Speed**: 72 km/h (20 m/s) initially, maintained throughout.
- **Lane width**: Assume the lateral distance between lanes (Y-axis) is 3.5 meters.
- **Lane change duration**: Approximately 2 seconds for each lane change (left and back).

### Trajectory:
1. **T = 0 s**: Initial position at (0, 0).
2. **T = 1 s**: Moving straight, position at (20, 0).
3. **T = 2 s**: Begin lane change to the left. Position at (40, 1.75).
4. **T = 3 s**: Continue lane change. Position at (60, 3.5).
5. **T = 4 s**: Fully in the left lane. Position at (80, 3.5).
6. **T = 5 s**: Pass the obstacle. Position at (100, 3.5).
7. **T = 6 s**: Begin lane change back to the right. Position at (120, 1.75).
8. **T = 7 s**: Continue lane change. Position at (140, 0).
9. **T = 8 s**: Fully back in the right lane. Position at (160, 0).
10. **T = 9 s**: Continue driving straight. Position at (180, 0).
11. **T = 10 s**: Continue driving straight. Position at (200, 0).

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|-----------------|
| 0 s      | (0, 0)          |
| 1 s      | (20, 0)         |
| 2 s      | (40, 1.75)      |
| 3 s      | (60, 3.5)       |
| 4 s      | (80, 3.5)       |
| 5 s      | (100, 3.5)      |
| 6 s      | (120, 1.75)     |
| 7 s      | (140, 0)        |
| 8 s      | (160, 0)        |
| 9 s      | (180, 0)        |
| 10 s     | (200, 0)        |

This trajectory ensures the vehicle safely changes lanes, passes the obstacle, and returns to the right lane while maintaining a speed of over 60 km/h.
