To describe the vehicle's trajectory for the lane-changing maneuver, we¡¯ll assume the vehicle maintains a speed of approximately 72 km/h (20 m/s) and completes the lane change smoothly. Here¡¯s the position of the vehicle over time:

1. **Initial Position (T = 0)**: (0, 0)  
   - The vehicle is in the right lane.

2. **T = 1 second**: (20, 0)  
   - The vehicle continues straight in the right lane, moving 20 meters forward.

3. **T = 2 seconds**: (40, 0)  
   - Still in the right lane, moving another 20 meters forward.

4. **T = 3 seconds**: (60, 0)  
   - The vehicle is now approaching the obstacle and begins to shift laterally toward the left lane.

5. **T = 4 seconds**: (80, -2)  
   - The vehicle starts moving into the left lane, with a lateral shift of 2 meters to the left.

6. **T = 5 seconds**: (100, -4)  
   - The vehicle is fully in the left lane, passing the obstacle at (100, 0).

7. **T = 6 seconds**: (120, -4)  
   - The vehicle continues in the left lane, moving 20 meters forward.

8. **T = 7 seconds**: (140, -4)  
   - Still in the left lane, moving another 20 meters forward.

9. **T = 8 seconds**: (160, -2)  
   - The vehicle begins shifting back toward the right lane.

10. **T = 9 seconds**: (180, 0)  
    - The vehicle completes the lane change and is back in the right lane.

11. **T = 10 seconds**: (200, 0)  
    - The vehicle continues straight in the right lane, moving another 20 meters forward.

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|-----------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, 0)         |
| 2        | (40, 0)         |
| 3        | (60, 0)         |
| 4        | (80, -2)        |
| 5        | (100, -4)       |
| 6        | (120, -4)       |
| 7        | (140, -4)       |
| 8        | (160, -2)       |
| 9        | (180, 0)        |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

This trajectory ensures the vehicle safely passes the obstacle while maintaining a speed of around 72 km/h.
