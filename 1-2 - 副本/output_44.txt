To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Accelerating and preparing to switch lanes (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)**  
2. **Switching to the left lane and passing the obstacle (T = 4 to T = 7 seconds)**  
3. **Switching back to the right lane after passing the obstacle (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds)**

### Assumptions:
- The vehicle¡¯s initial speed is 72 km/h (20 m/s).  
- The vehicle accelerates slightly to ensure smooth lane changes and maintains a speed above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).  
- The lane width is approximately 3.5 meters, so the lateral shift (Y) will be 3.5 meters to the left.  
- The obstacle is at (100, 0), and the vehicle needs to pass it safely.

### Trajectory:
Here¡¯s the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at each second:

- **T = 0 seconds**: (0, 0)  
  Initial position, right lane.

- **T = 1 second**: (20, 0)  
  Moving forward at 20 m/s.

- **T = 2 seconds**: (40, 0)  
  Continuing in the right lane.

- **T = 3 seconds**: (60, 0)  
  Preparing to switch lanes.

- **T = 4 seconds**: (80, 1.75)  
  Starting to move into the left lane (halfway across).

- **T = 5 seconds**: (100, 3.5)  
  Fully in the left lane, passing the obstacle.

- **T = 6 seconds**: (120, 3.5)  
  Moving forward in the left lane.

- **T = 7 seconds**: (140, 3.5)  
  Continuing in the left lane.

- **T = 8 seconds**: (160, 1.75)  
  Starting to move back into the right lane (halfway across).

- **T = 9 seconds**: (180, 0)  
  Fully back in the right lane.

- **T = 10 seconds**: (200, 0)  
  Continuing in the right lane.

### Explanation:
- The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.  
- The lane change is smooth, taking 1 second to shift 3.5 meters laterally.  
- The obstacle is safely passed in the left lane between T = 4 and T = 7 seconds.  
- The vehicle returns to the right lane by T = 10 seconds.

This trajectory ensures the vehicle stays above 60 km/h and completes the maneuver safely.
