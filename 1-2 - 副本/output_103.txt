To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we'll break down the maneuver into three phases:  
1. **Lane Change to the Left Lane**  
2. **Passing the Obstacle**  
3. **Lane Change Back to the Right Lane**  

### Assumptions:  
- The vehicle's initial speed is 72 km/h, which is 20 m/s.  
- The left lane is at \( Y = -3.5 \) meters (assuming standard lane width).  
- The obstacle is at \( (100, 0) \).  
- The lane change takes approximately 2 seconds.  
- The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s throughout the maneuver.  

### Trajectory:  
#### **Phase 1: Lane Change to the Left Lane (T = 0 to T = 2)**  
At \( T = 0 \): \( (0, 0) \)  
At \( T = 1 \): \( (20, -1.75) \) (halfway through the lane change)  
At \( T = 2 \): \( (40, -3.5) \) (fully in the left lane)  

#### **Phase 2: Passing the Obstacle (T = 2 to T = 6)**  
The vehicle continues in the left lane, passing the obstacle at \( X = 100 \).  
At \( T = 3 \): \( (60, -3.5) \)  
At \( T = 4 \): \( (80, -3.5) \)  
At \( T = 5 \): \( (100, -3.5) \) (passing the obstacle)  
At \( T = 6 \): \( (120, -3.5) \)  

#### **Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Right Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)**  
At \( T = 7 \): \( (140, -1.75) \) (halfway through the lane change)  
At \( T = 8 \): \( (160, 0) \) (fully back in the right lane)  

### Final Trajectory Table:  
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) in meters |  
|----------|---------------------------|  
| 0        | (0, 0)                    |  
| 1        | (20, -1.75)               |  
| 2        | (40, -3.5)                |  
| 3        | (60, -3.5)                |  
| 4        | (80, -3.5)                |  
| 5        | (100, -3.5)               |  
| 6        | (120, -3.5)               |  
| 7        | (140, -1.75)              |  
| 8        | (160, 0)                  |  

This trajectory ensures the vehicle safely changes lanes, passes the obstacle, and returns to the right lane while maintaining a speed of 72 km/h.
