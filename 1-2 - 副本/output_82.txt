To describe the trajectory, we¡¯ll assume the following:

1. The vehicle starts at position (0, 0) at time T = 0.
2. The vehicle is moving at a constant speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) in the right lane.
3. The left lane is at Y = 4 meters (assuming the lane width is 4 meters).
4. The obstacle is at (100, 0), and the vehicle needs to switch to the left lane, pass the obstacle, and switch back to the right lane.
5. The lane change takes approximately 2 seconds (smooth transition).

Here¡¯s the trajectory for the next 10 seconds:

- **T = 0 s**: Position = (0, 0)  
  The vehicle is in the right lane, starting to accelerate or maintain speed.

- **T = 1 s**: Position = (20, 0)  
  The vehicle continues in the right lane, moving forward at 20 m/s.

- **T = 2 s**: Position = (40, 0)  
  Still in the right lane, approaching the obstacle.

- **T = 3 s**: Position = (60, 1)  
  The vehicle begins the lane change to the left lane, moving laterally at 1 m/s.

- **T = 4 s**: Position = (80, 2)  
  Continuing the lane change, halfway into the left lane.

- **T = 5 s**: Position = (100, 3)  
  The vehicle is almost fully in the left lane, passing the obstacle at (100, 0).

- **T = 6 s**: Position = (120, 4)  
  The vehicle is now fully in the left lane, having passed the obstacle.

- **T = 7 s**: Position = (140, 3)  
  The vehicle begins to transition back to the right lane.

- **T = 8 s**: Position = (160, 2)  
  Continuing the transition back to the right lane.

- **T = 9 s**: Position = (180, 1)  
  Almost fully back in the right lane.

- **T = 10 s**: Position = (200, 0)  
  The vehicle is fully back in the right lane, continuing forward.

### Key Details:
- The lane change starts at T = 3 s and is completed by T = 6 s.
- The return to the right lane starts at T = 7 s and is completed by T = 10 s.
- The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.

This trajectory ensures the vehicle safely passes the obstacle while maintaining speed and staying in the correct lanes.
