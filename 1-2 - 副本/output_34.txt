To plan the trajectory for the lane-changing maneuver, we¡¯ll break it into phases: **acceleration, lane change, passing the obstacle, and returning to the right lane**. The initial speed is 72 km/h (20 m/s), and we¡¯ll aim to maintain a speed above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).

### Assumptions:
1. The vehicle accelerates slightly to ensure smooth lane changes.
2. The lane change takes about 3 seconds to complete.
3. The vehicle passes the obstacle in the left lane and returns to the right lane afterward.
4. The lateral movement (Y) is linear during the lane change.

### Trajectory:
Let¡¯s define the positions at each second (T = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10).

#### Phase 1: Initial Movement (T = 0 to T = 2)
- The vehicle continues in the right lane (Y = 0) at 20 m/s.
- Positions:
  - T = 0: (0, 0)
  - T = 1: (20, 0)
  - T = 2: (40, 0)

#### Phase 2: Lane Change to the Left (T = 3 to T = 5)
- The vehicle begins moving leftward (Y increases linearly from 0 to 3.5 meters, assuming lane width is 3.5 meters).
- Speed remains at 20 m/s.
- Positions:
  - T = 3: (60, 0)
  - T = 4: (80, 1.75)
  - T = 5: (100, 3.5)

#### Phase 3: Passing the Obstacle (T = 6 to T = 8)
- The vehicle remains in the left lane (Y = 3.5) and passes the obstacle at X = 100 meters.
- Positions:
  - T = 6: (120, 3.5)
  - T = 7: (140, 3.5)
  - T = 8: (160, 3.5)

#### Phase 4: Lane Change to the Right (T = 9 to T = 10)
- The vehicle begins moving rightward (Y decreases linearly from 3.5 to 0 meters).
- Speed remains at 20 m/s.
- Positions:
  - T = 9: (180, 1.75)
  - T = 10: (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|-----------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, 0)         |
| 2        | (40, 0)         |
| 3        | (60, 0)         |
| 4        | (80, 1.75)      |
| 5        | (100, 3.5)      |
| 6        | (120, 3.5)      |
| 7        | (140, 3.5)      |
| 8        | (160, 3.5)      |
| 9        | (180, 1.75)     |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

This trajectory ensures the vehicle safely passes the obstacle while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
