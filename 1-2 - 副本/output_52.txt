To describe the trajectory of the vehicle as it switches lanes to pass the obstacle and then returns to the right lane, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into phases: acceleration, lane change, passing, lane change back, and deceleration. The initial speed is 72 km/h (20 m/s), and we¡¯ll aim to maintain a speed of at least 60 km/h (16.67 m/s) throughout. Here¡¯s the trajectory in (X, Y) coordinates at 1-second intervals:

---

### **Phase 1: Acceleration (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)**
- The vehicle accelerates slightly to prepare for the lane change.
- **T = 0:** (0, 0)  
- **T = 1:** (20, 0)  
- **T = 2:** (40, 0)  

---

### **Phase 2: Lane Change to Left Lane (T = 3 to T = 5 seconds)**
- The vehicle smoothly transitions to the left lane (Y = -4 meters, assuming a standard lane width of 4 meters).
- **T = 3:** (60, -1)  
- **T = 4:** (80, -2)  
- **T = 5:** (100, -4)  

---

### **Phase 3: Passing the Obstacle (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)**
- The vehicle stays in the left lane and passes the obstacle at (100, 0).
- **T = 6:** (120, -4)  
- **T = 7:** (140, -4)  
- **T = 8:** (160, -4)  

---

### **Phase 4: Lane Change Back to Right Lane (T = 9 to T = 11 seconds)**
- The vehicle transitions back to the right lane (Y = 0).
- **T = 9:** (180, -3)  
- **T = 10:** (200, -2)  
- **T = 11:** (220, 0)  

---

### **Phase 5: Continue Driving (T = 12 seconds)**
- The vehicle continues in the right lane at a steady speed.
- **T = 12:** (240, 0)

| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)           |
| 1        | (20, 0)          |
| 2        | (40, 0)          |
| 3        | (60, -1)         |
| 4        | (80, -2)         |
| 5        | (100, -4)        |
| 6        | (120, -4)        |
| 7        | (140, -4)        |
| 8        | (160, -4)        |
| 9        | (180, -3)        |
| 10       | (200, -2)        |
| 11       | (220, 0)         |
| 12       | (240, 0)         |

This trajectory ensures the vehicle safely passes the obstacle while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h and completes the lane-changing maneuver smoothly.
