To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we¡¯ll assume the following:
- The vehicle moves at a constant speed of **72 km/h (20 m/s)**.
- Lane width is approximately **3.5 meters**.
- The lane change maneuver takes **3 seconds** to complete (smooth transition).
- The obstacle is at **(100, 0)** and the vehicle needs to switch to the left lane (Y = -3.5 m) to pass it.

### Trajectory Plan:
1. **T = 0 to T = 3 seconds**: Lane change to the left lane.
2. **T = 3 to T = 7 seconds**: Continue in the left lane, passing the obstacle.
3. **T = 7 to T = 10 seconds**: Lane change back to the right lane.

### Position Calculations:
- **X-coordinate**: Moves at 20 m/s, so \( X = 20 \times T \).
- **Y-coordinate**: Smooth transition during lane changes.

#### Detailed Positions:
1. **T = 0**: (0, 0) - Starting position in the right lane.
2. **T = 1**: (20, -1.17) - Smooth transition to the left lane.
3. **T = 2**: (40, -2.33) - Continuing lane change.
4. **T = 3**: (60, -3.5) - Fully in the left lane.
5. **T = 4**: (80, -3.5) - Passing the obstacle.
6. **T = 5**: (100, -3.5) - Passing the obstacle.
7. **T = 6**: (120, -3.5) - Passing the obstacle.
8. **T = 7**: (140, -3.5) - Preparing to switch back.
9. **T = 8**: (160, -2.33) - Smooth transition to the right lane.
10. **T = 9**: (180, -1.17) - Continuing lane change.
11. **T = 10**: (200, 0) - Fully back in the right lane.

### Summary Table:
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) (meters) |
|----------|--------------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)                   |
| 1        | (20, -1.17)              |
| 2        | (40, -2.33)              |
| 3        | (60, -3.5)               |
| 4        | (80, -3.5)               |
| 5        | (100, -3.5)              |
| 6        | (120, -3.5)              |
| 7        | (140, -3.5)              |
| 8        | (160, -2.33)             |
| 9        | (180, -1.17)             |
| 10       | (200, 0)                 |

This trajectory ensures the vehicle maintains a speed of 72 km/h, safely passes the obstacle, and returns to the right lane.
