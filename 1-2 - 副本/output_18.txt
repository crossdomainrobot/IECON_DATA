To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we¡¯ll break it down into three phases:  
1. **Lane change to the left lane** (from Y = 0 to Y = -3 meters, assuming lane width is 3 meters).  
2. **Passing the obstacle vehicle** while staying in the left lane.  
3. **Lane change back to the right lane** (from Y = -3 to Y = 0 meters).  

### Assumptions:  
- The vehicle¡¯s initial speed is **72 km/h (20 m/s)**.  
- The lane width is **3 meters**.  
- The obstacle is at **(100, 0)**.  
- The lane change takes **3 seconds** (1 second to start, 1 second to stabilize, 1 second to complete).  
- The vehicle maintains a speed of **20 m/s (72 km/h)** throughout the maneuver.  

### Trajectory:  
Here¡¯s the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at each second (T):  

#### Phase 1: Lane change to the left lane (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)  
- **T = 0 s**: (0, 0)  
- **T = 1 s**: (20, -1)  
- **T = 2 s**: (40, -2)  
- **T = 3 s**: (60, -3)  

#### Phase 2: Passing the obstacle vehicle (T = 4 to T = 6 seconds)  
- **T = 4 s**: (80, -3)  
- **T = 5 s**: (100, -3)  
- **T = 6 s**: (120, -3)  

#### Phase 3: Lane change back to the right lane (T = 7 to T = 9 seconds)  
- **T = 7 s**: (140, -2)  
- **T = 8 s**: (160, -1)  
- **T = 9 s**: (180, 0)  

#### Phase 4: Continuing in the right lane (T = 10 seconds)  
- **T = 10 s**: (200, 0)  

### Summary:  
The vehicle smoothly changes lanes, passes the obstacle, and returns to the right lane within 10 seconds. The speed is maintained at 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
