To describe the trajectory of the vehicle for the lane-changing maneuver, we¡¯ll assume the following:

1. The vehicle starts at position (0, 0) at time T = 0.
2. The vehicle moves at a constant speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) along the X-axis.
3. The lane width is approximately 3.5 meters, so switching to the left lane involves a lateral displacement of 3.5 meters (Y-axis).
4. The lane change takes about 3 seconds to complete smoothly.
5. The obstacle is at (100, 0), and the vehicle will switch back to the right lane after passing it.

Here¡¯s the trajectory in (X, Y) coordinates at 1-second intervals:

### **Time T = 0:**
- Position: (0, 0)
- Action: Start moving forward in the right lane.

### **Time T = 1:**
- Position: (20, 0)
- Action: Continue in the right lane.

### **Time T = 2:**
- Position: (40, 0)
- Action: Begin lane change to the left.

### **Time T = 3:**
- Position: (60, 1.75)
- Action: Midway through the lane change.

### **Time T = 4:**
- Position: (80, 3.5)
- Action: Complete the lane change; now in the left lane.

### **Time T = 5:**
- Position: (100, 3.5)
- Action: Pass the obstacle in the left lane.

### **Time T = 6:**
- Position: (120, 3.5)
- Action: Continue in the left lane.

### **Time T = 7:**
- Position: (140, 3.5)
- Action: Begin lane change back to the right lane.

### **Time T = 8:**
- Position: (160, 1.75)
- Action: Midway through the lane change.

### **Time T = 9:**
- Position: (180, 0)
- Action: Complete the lane change; back in the right lane.

### **Time T = 10:**
- Position: (200, 0)
- Action: Continue driving in the right lane.

### Summary of Trajectory:
| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|-----------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, 0)         |
| 2        | (40, 0)         |
| 3        | (60, 1.75)      |
| 4        | (80, 3.5)       |
| 5        | (100, 3.5)      |
| 6        | (120, 3.5)      |
| 7        | (140, 3.5)      |
| 8        | (160, 1.75)     |
| 9        | (180, 0)        |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

This trajectory ensures the vehicle passes the obstacle safely while maintaining a speed of 72 km/h and adhering to lane-changing rules.
