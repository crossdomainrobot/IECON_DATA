To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into phases: **acceleration**, **lane change**, **passing the obstacle**, and **returning to the right lane**. The initial speed is 72 km/h (20 m/s), and we¡¯ll maintain a speed above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s). Here¡¯s the trajectory:

### Assumptions:
1. The obstacle is at (100, 0).
2. The left lane is at Y = -3.5 meters (assuming a standard lane width of 3.5 meters).
3. The vehicle accelerates slightly to ensure smooth lane changes and passing.
4. Lane changes take approximately 2 seconds each.

### Trajectory:

#### **Phase 1: Acceleration (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)**
- The vehicle accelerates slightly from 20 m/s to 22 m/s.
- Position at T = 1: (20, 0)
- Position at T = 2: (44, 0)

#### **Phase 2: Lane Change to the Left (T = 2 to T = 4 seconds)**
- The vehicle smoothly transitions to the left lane (Y = -3.5 meters).
- Position at T = 3: (66, -1.75)
- Position at T = 4: (88, -3.5)

#### **Phase 3: Passing the Obstacle (T = 4 to T = 6 seconds)**
- The vehicle continues in the left lane, passing the obstacle at X = 100 meters.
- Position at T = 5: (110, -3.5)
- Position at T = 6: (132, -3.5)

#### **Phase 4: Lane Change to the Right (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)**
- The vehicle smoothly transitions back to the right lane (Y = 0 meters).
- Position at T = 7: (154, -1.75)
- Position at T = 8: (176, 0)

#### **Phase 5: Continuing in the Right Lane (T = 8 onwards)**
- The vehicle continues in the right lane at 22 m/s.
- Position at T = 9: (198, 0)
- Position at T = 10: (220, 0)

### Summary of Positions:
- T = 0: (0, 0)
- T = 1: (20, 0)
- T = 2: (44, 0)
- T = 3: (66, -1.75)
- T = 4: (88, -3.5)
- T = 5: (110, -3.5)
- T = 6: (132, -3.5)
- T = 7: (154, -1.75)
- T = 8: (176, 0)
- T = 9: (198, 0)
- T = 10: (220, 0)

This trajectory ensures the vehicle safely passes the obstacle while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
