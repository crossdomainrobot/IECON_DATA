To describe the trajectory of the vehicle as it switches lanes, passes the obstacle, and switches back, we can break the maneuver into phases: (1) lane change to the left, (2) passing the obstacle, and (3) lane change back to the right. We'll assume smooth transitions and constant speed during the maneuver.

### Assumptions:
- **Initial speed**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s (converted for simplicity).
- **Lane width**: Assume each lane is 3.5 meters wide.
- **Time for lane change**: Assume 2 seconds for each lane change (left and right).
- **Passing distance**: Assume the vehicle starts passing the obstacle at \( X = 90 \) meters and completes passing at \( X = 110 \) meters.

### Trajectory Description:

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change to the Left (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)**
- The vehicle moves from \( Y = 0 \) (right lane) to \( Y = -3.5 \) meters (left lane) over 2 seconds.
- During this phase, the vehicle continues moving forward at 20 m/s.

Positions:
- \( T = 0 \): \( (0, 0) \)
- \( T = 1 \): \( (20, -1.75) \)
- \( T = 2 \): \( (40, -3.5) \)

#### **Phase 2: Passing the Obstacle (T = 2 to T = 6 seconds)**
- The vehicle continues in the left lane (\( Y = -3.5 \)) and passes the obstacle.
- The vehicle moves from \( X = 40 \) meters to \( X = 120 \) meters in 4 seconds.

Positions:
- \( T = 3 \): \( (60, -3.5) \)
- \( T = 4 \): \( (80, -3.5) \)
- \( T = 5 \): \( (100, -3.5) \)
- \( T = 6 \): \( (120, -3.5) \)

#### **Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Right (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)**
- The vehicle moves from \( Y = -3.5 \) meters (left lane) to \( Y = 0 \) (right lane) over 2 seconds.
- During this phase, the vehicle continues moving forward at 20 m/s.

Positions:
- \( T = 7 \): \( (140, -1.75) \)
- \( T = 8 \): \( (160, 0) \)

#### **Phase 4: Continue in the Right Lane (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds)**
- The vehicle continues in the right lane (\( Y = 0 \)) at 20 m/s.

Positions:
- \( T = 9 \): \( (180, 0) \)
- \( T = 10 \): \( (200, 0) \)

### Final Trajectory:
- \( T = 0 \): \( (0, 0) \)
- \( T = 1 \): \( (20, -1.75) \)
- \( T = 2 \): \( (40, -3.5) \)
- \( T = 3 \): \( (60, -3.5) \)
- \( T = 4 \): \( (80, -3.5) \)
- \( T = 5 \): \( (100, -3.5) \)
- \( T = 6 \): \( (120, -3.5) \)
- \( T = 7 \): \( (140, -1.75) \)
- \( T = 8 \): \( (160, 0) \)
- \( T = 9 \): \( (180, 0) \)
- \( T = 10 \): \( (200, 0) \)

This trajectory ensures the vehicle safely switches lanes, passes the obstacle, and returns to the right lane while maintaining a speed of 72 km/h.
