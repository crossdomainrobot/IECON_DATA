To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:  
1. **Lane change to the left lane**  
2. **Passing the obstacle**  
3. **Lane change back to the right lane**  

### Assumptions:  
- The vehicle is initially at (0, 0) in the right lane (Y = 0).  
- The left lane is at Y = -3.5 meters (typical lane width).  
- The obstacle is at (100, 0).  
- The vehicle speed is 72 km/h (20 m/s).  
- The lane change takes approximately 3 seconds (smooth transition).  

### Trajectory:  

#### Phase 1: Lane change to the left lane (T = 0 to T = 3)  
- The vehicle moves from Y = 0 to Y = -3.5 meters while maintaining a speed of 20 m/s.  
- The X position increases linearly: X = 20 * T.  

#### Phase 2: Passing the obstacle (T = 3 to T = 7)  
- The vehicle continues in the left lane (Y = -3.5 meters) at 20 m/s.  
- The X position increases linearly: X = 20 * T.  

#### Phase 3: Lane change back to the right lane (T = 7 to T = 10)  
- The vehicle moves from Y = -3.5 meters to Y = 0 while maintaining a speed of 20 m/s.  
- The X position increases linearly: X = 20 * T.  

### Trajectory Table:  

| Time (T) | X Position (m) | Y Position (m) |  
|----------|----------------|----------------|  
| 0        | 0              | 0              |  
| 1        | 20             | -1.17          |  
| 2        | 40             | -2.33          |  
| 3        | 60             | -3.5           |  
| 4        | 80             | -3.5           |  
| 5        | 100            | -3.5           |  
| 6        | 120            | -3.5           |  
| 7        | 140            | -3.5           |  
| 8        | 160            | -2.33          |  
| 9        | 180            | -1.17          |  
| 10       | 200            | 0              |  

### Explanation:  
- The lane change is modeled as a linear transition in Y over 3 seconds.  
- The vehicle passes the obstacle at T = 5, when X = 100 meters.  
- The vehicle returns to the right lane by T = 10.  

This trajectory ensures the vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) and safely avoids the obstacle.
