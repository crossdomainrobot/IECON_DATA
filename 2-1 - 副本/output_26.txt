To safely execute the double-lane change maneuver while maintaining highway speed, we need to carefully plan the trajectory. Below is a step-by-step description of the vehicle's position at each second (T = 1, 2, ..., until the maneuver finishes). The goal is to:

1. Gradually move into the left lane before reaching the obstacle.
2. Stay in the left lane as the vehicle passes the obstacle at X = 100.
3. Gradually return to the right lane after passing the obstacle.

### Key Assumptions:
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s (constant speed throughout the maneuver).
- Lane width: Y = -5 for the left lane, Y = 0 for the right lane.
- Obstacle location: (X, Y) = (100, 0).

### Trajectory Plan

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change to Left Lane**
We will gradually shift from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -5) over the first few seconds.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) | Notes                                   |
|----------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| T = 0    | (0, 0)          | Starting point in the right lane.       |
| T = 1    | (20, -1)        | Begin shifting leftward.                |
| T = 2    | (40, -2)        | Continue moving leftward.               |
| T = 3    | (60, -3)        | Halfway to the left lane.              |
| T = 4    | (80, -4)        | Almost fully in the left lane.         |
| T = 5    | (100, -5)       | Fully in the left lane, passing obstacle. |

#### **Phase 2: Passing the Obstacle**
While in the left lane, the vehicle continues forward at constant speed (20 m/s) and stays in the left lane until it has safely passed the obstacle.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) | Notes                                   |
|----------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| T = 6    | (120, -5)       | Still in the left lane, past the obstacle. |
| T = 7    | (140, -5)       | Continuing in the left lane.            |

---

#### **Phase 3: Lane Change Back to Right Lane**
After passing the obstacle, the vehicle begins shifting back to the right lane.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) | Notes                                   |
|----------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| T = 8    | (160, -4)       | Begin shifting rightward.               |
| T = 9    | (180, -3)       | Continue moving rightward.              |
| T = 10   | (200, -2)       | Almost fully in the right lane.         |
| T = 11   | (220, -1)       | Final adjustment toward the right lane.  |
| T = 12   | (240, 0)        | Fully back in the right lane.           |

Here¡¯s the complete trajectory for the vehicle:

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| T = 0    | (0, 0)          |
| T = 1    | (20, -1)        |
| T = 2    | (40, -2)        |
| T = 3    | (60, -3)        |
| T = 4    | (80, -4)        |
| T = 5    | (100, -5)       |
| T = 6    | (120, -5)       |
| T = 7    | (140, -5)       |
| T = 8    | (160, -4)       |
| T = 9    | (180, -3)       |
| T = 10   | (200, -2)       |
| T = 11   | (220, -1)       |
| T = 12   | (240, 0)        |

This trajectory ensures that the vehicle safely completes the double-lane change maneuver while adhering to highway speed requirements.
