To safely execute the double lane change maneuver, we need to ensure that the vehicle smoothly transitions from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -5), overtakes the obstacle at X = 100, and then returns to the right lane (Y = 0). The trajectory must also maintain a speed of over 60 km/h (approximately 16.67 m/s).

Here is a step-by-step trajectory for the next 10 seconds:

### Initial Conditions:
- **Initial position**: (0, 0)
- **Initial velocity**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s
- **Obstacle position**: (100, 0)

### Trajectory Plan:
1. Start in the right lane (Y = 0).
2. Gradually move to the left lane (Y = -5) before reaching X = 100.
3. Stay in the left lane while passing the obstacle at X = 100.
4. Gradually return to the right lane (Y = 0) after passing the obstacle.

The vehicle will follow a smooth lateral transition using a sinusoidal-like curve for the Y-coordinate to ensure a safe and comfortable lane change.

### Position at Each Time Step (T = 1, 2, ..., 10):

#### T = 1 second:
- **X** = 20 m (since the initial speed is 20 m/s)
- **Y** = -0.5 m (gradual transition to the left lane begins)
- **Position**: (20, -0.5)

#### T = 2 seconds:
- **X** = 40 m
- **Y** = -1.5 m (continuing the transition to the left lane)
- **Position**: (40, -1.5)

#### T = 3 seconds:
- **X** = 60 m
- **Y** = -3 m (approaching the left lane)
- **Position**: (60, -3)

#### T = 4 seconds:
- **X** = 80 m
- **Y** = -4 m (almost fully in the left lane)
- **Position**: (80, -4)

#### T = 5 seconds:
- **X** = 100 m (reaching the obstacle's position)
- **Y** = -5 m (fully in the left lane, passing the obstacle)
- **Position**: (100, -5)

#### T = 6 seconds:
- **X** = 120 m (past the obstacle)
- **Y** = -4 m (starting to transition back to the right lane)
- **Position**: (120, -4)

#### T = 7 seconds:
- **X** = 140 m
- **Y** = -3 m (continuing the transition back to the right lane)
- **Position**: (140, -3)

#### T = 8 seconds:
- **X** = 160 m
- **Y** = -1.5 m (further transitioning back to the right lane)
- **Position**: (160, -1.5)

#### T = 9 seconds:
- **X** = 180 m
- **Y** = -0.5 m (almost fully back in the right lane)
- **Position**: (180, -0.5)

#### T = 10 seconds:
- **X** = 200 m
- **Y** = 0 m (fully back in the right lane)
- **Position**: (200, 0)

### Summary:
The vehicle successfully completes the double lane change maneuver by:
1. Transitioning to the left lane before reaching the obstacle.
2. Passing the obstacle while staying in the left lane.
3. Returning to the right lane after passing the obstacle.

This trajectory ensures safety, comfort, and adherence to highway speed requirements.
