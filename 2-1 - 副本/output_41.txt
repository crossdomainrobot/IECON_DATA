To safely navigate the double lane change maneuver, I will provide a trajectory for the vehicle that ensures smooth transitions while adhering to highway speed limits. The initial velocity is 72 km/h (or approximately 20 m/s), and we need to stay above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s). Let's plan the trajectory step by step.

---

### **Initial Setup**
- Initial position: (0, 0)
- Obstacle location: (100, 0)
- Left lane Y-coordinate: -5
- Velocity: Start at 20 m/s, adjust as needed during lane changes.
- Highway minimum speed: Stay above 16.67 m/s.

### **Trajectory Plan**
We will divide the maneuver into three phases:
1. **Lane Change to the Left Lane**: Gradually move from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
2. **Pass the Obstacle in the Left Lane**: Maintain position at Y = -5 while passing X = 100.
3. **Lane Change Back to the Right Lane**: Gradually return from Y = -5 to Y = 0 after passing the obstacle.

Below is the detailed trajectory for the next 10 seconds:

### **Timepoint-by-Timepoint Trajectory**

#### **T = 0**
- Position: (0, 0)
- Velocity: 20 m/s along X-axis.

#### **T = 1**
- Position: (20, -1)  
  (Start moving slightly left to begin lane change.)
- Velocity: ~19.5 m/s along X-axis, slight lateral movement.

#### **T = 2**
- Position: (40, -2)  
  (Continue gradual leftward movement.)
- Velocity: ~19 m/s along X-axis, increasing lateral speed.

#### **T = 3**
- Position: (60, -3)  
  (Approaching halfway to the left lane.)
- Velocity: ~18.5 m/s along X-axis, more lateral movement.

#### **T = 4**
- Position: (80, -4)  
  (Almost fully in the left lane.)
- Velocity: ~18 m/s along X-axis, completing lane change.

#### **T = 5**
- Position: (100, -5)  
  (Fully in the left lane, passing the obstacle at X = 100.)
- Velocity: 20 m/s along X-axis, no lateral movement.

#### **T = 6**
- Position: (120, -5)  
  (Continuing straight in the left lane.)
- Velocity: 20 m/s along X-axis.

#### **T = 7**
- Position: (140, -4)  
  (Start moving back to the right lane.)
- Velocity: ~19.5 m/s along X-axis, slight lateral movement.

#### **T = 8**
- Position: (160, -3)  
  (Gradual return to the right lane.)
- Velocity: ~19 m/s along X-axis, increasing lateral speed.

#### **T = 9**
- Position: (180, -2)  
  (Approaching the right lane.)
- Velocity: ~18.5 m/s along X-axis, more lateral movement.

#### **T = 10**
- Position: (200, 0)  
  (Fully back in the right lane.)
- Velocity: 20 m/s along X-axis, no lateral movement.

### **Key Notes**
1. **Speed Management**: Throughout the maneuver, the vehicle maintains a speed of at least 16.67 m/s (60 km/h), ensuring compliance with highway regulations.
2. **Smooth Lateral Movement**: The lateral movement (Y-coordinate) is gradual to ensure passenger comfort and vehicle stability.
3. **Obstacle Clearance**: The vehicle stays in the left lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstacle at X = 100.

This trajectory ensures a safe and efficient double lane change maneuver while adhering to highway driving rules.
