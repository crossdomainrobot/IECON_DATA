To safely navigate the double lane change maneuver while maintaining highway speed and ensuring safety, I will plan a trajectory that smoothly transitions to the left lane, passes the obstacle, and then transitions back to the right lane. The vehicle's initial speed is 72 km/h (or approximately 20 m/s), and it must stay above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s). 

Below is the planned trajectory for the next 10 seconds:

### **Trajectory Planning**
- **Initial Position**: (0, 0)
- **Obstacle Location**: (100, 0)
- **Left Lane Y-coordinate**: -5
- **Right Lane Y-coordinate**: 0

The vehicle will:
1. Gradually transition to the left lane over the first few seconds.
2. Maintain the left lane position as it passes the obstacle at X = 100.
3. Gradually return to the right lane after passing the obstacle.

| T = 9    | 180      | 0        | Finalize transition back to the right lane.                             |

### **Explanation of the Maneuver**
1. **Transition to Left Lane**:
   - From T = 0 to T = 4, the vehicle gradually moves from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -5).
   - The lateral movement is smooth and gradual to ensure stability and passenger comfort.

2. **Passing the Obstacle**:
   - At T = 5, the vehicle is fully in the left lane (Y = -5) and aligned with the obstacle at X = 100.
   - The vehicle maintains its speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) throughout this phase.

3. **Transition Back to Right Lane**:
   - From T = 6 to T = 9, the vehicle gradually transitions back to the right lane (Y = 0).
   - By T = 9, the vehicle has completed the transition and resumes normal highway driving.

4. **Maintaining Highway Speed**:
   - The vehicle's longitudinal speed remains constant at 72 km/h (20 m/s), ensuring compliance with highway speed regulations.

This trajectory ensures a safe, smooth, and efficient double lane change maneuver while adhering to highway driving requirements.
