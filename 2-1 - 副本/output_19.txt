To plan a safe and smooth trajectory for the double lane change maneuver, we need to carefully adjust the vehicle's lateral position (Y) while maintaining a velocity of over 60 km/h along the longitudinal axis (X). The vehicle starts at (0, 0) and needs to safely pass the obstacle located at (100, 0) by switching to the left lane (Y = -5) and then returning to the right lane after passing the obstacle.

### Key Details:
- Initial speed: 72 km/h = 20 m/s
- Minimum speed on the highway: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s
- Obstacle location: (100, 0)
- Left lane Y-coordinate: -5
- Right lane Y-coordinate: 0

We will use a smooth trajectory with gradual changes in Y to avoid abrupt maneuvers. Here¡¯s the planned trajectory:

### Trajectory Plan:
#### **Phase 1: Start Lane Change to Left Lane (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)**
- Gradually decrease Y from 0 to -5 while maintaining speed close to 20 m/s.
- At T = 3 seconds, the vehicle should fully transition to the left lane (Y = -5).

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -1.67 |
| 2        | 40    | -3.33 |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |

---

#### **Phase 2: Maintain Left Lane and Approach Obstacle (T = 3 to T = 7 seconds)**
- Keep Y constant at -5.
- Continue driving at approximately 20 m/s to reach the obstacle at X = 100 by T = 7 seconds.

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |

At T = 5 seconds, the vehicle is directly aligned with the obstacle but safely in the left lane.

---

#### **Phase 3: Start Lane Change Back to Right Lane (T = 5 to T = 8 seconds)**
- Gradually increase Y from -5 to 0 while continuing forward motion.
- At T = 8 seconds, the vehicle should be fully back in the right lane (Y = 0).

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -3.33 |
| 7        | 140   | -1.67 |
| 8        | 160   | 0     |

---

#### **Phase 4: Continue Driving in Right Lane (T = 8 onwards)**
- Maintain Y = 0 and continue driving at a speed of around 20 m/s.

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 9        | 180   | 0     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### Final Summary of Positions:
| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -1.67 |
| 2        | 40    | -3.33 |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -3.33 |
| 7        | 140   | -1.67 |
| 8        | 160   | 0     |
| 9        | 180   | 0     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

This trajectory ensures that the vehicle smoothly transitions to the left lane, safely passes the obstacle, and returns to the right lane without exceeding or dropping below the required speed limits.
