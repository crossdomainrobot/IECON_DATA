To safely navigate around the obstacle and complete the double lane change maneuver, we will plan a trajectory that ensures smooth transitions between lanes while maintaining highway speed. Below is the detailed trajectory for the next 10 seconds (or until the maneuver is completed). 

### Key Assumptions:
1. **Initial Speed**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
2. **Minimum Highway Speed**: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.
3. **Lane Width**: Y = 0 (right lane), Y = -5 (left lane).
4. **Obstacle Location**: (X, Y) = (100, 0).

We will use a combination of lateral movement (Y-direction) and longitudinal movement (X-direction) to ensure the vehicle stays within safe limits.

### Trajectory Plan:

#### **Phase 1: Start Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 3)**
- Begin moving laterally into the left lane while maintaining speed.
- Gradually decrease speed slightly to allow more time for the lane change if necessary.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -1.5)      |
| 2        | (40, -3.0)      |
| 3        | (60, -4.5)      |

At T = 3, the vehicle is nearly in the left lane (Y ¡Ö -5).

---

#### **Phase 2: Fully Enter Left Lane and Accelerate (T = 3 to T = 6)**
- Complete the lane change by aligning with Y = -5.
- Maintain or slightly increase speed to ensure highway regulations are met.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 3        | (60, -4.5)      |
| 4        | (80, -5.0)      |
| 5        | (100, -5.0)     |
| 6        | (120, -5.0)     |

At T = 5, the vehicle passes the obstacle at X = 100 while fully in the left lane (Y = -5).

---

#### **Phase 3: Return to Right Lane (T = 6 to T = 9)**
- Begin moving laterally back to the right lane while maintaining speed.
- Ensure smooth re-entry into the right lane.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 6        | (120, -5.0)     |
| 7        | (140, -3.5)     |
| 8        | (160, -2.0)     |
| 9        | (180, -0.5)     |

At T = 9, the vehicle is nearly back in the right lane.

---

#### **Phase 4: Fully Re-enter Right Lane (T = 9 to T = 10)**
- Align completely with the right lane (Y = 0).
- Maintain highway speed.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 9        | (180, -0.5)     |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

### Final Trajectory Summary:
The vehicle successfully completes the double lane change maneuver while maintaining highway speed and safely passing the obstacle.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -1.5)      |
| 2        | (40, -3.0)      |
| 3        | (60, -4.5)      |
| 4        | (80, -5.0)      |
| 5        | (100, -5.0)     |
| 6        | (120, -5.0)     |
| 7        | (140, -3.5)     |
| 8        | (160, -2.0)     |
| 9        | (180, -0.5)     |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

This trajectory ensures a safe and smooth transition through the obstacle.
