To safely navigate around the obstacle and ensure a smooth double lane change maneuver, we need to carefully plan the trajectory of the vehicle. The goal is to move from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -5), overtake the stopped vehicle at X = 100, and then return to the right lane (Y = 0). We must maintain a velocity above 60 km/h (approximately 16.67 m/s) while executing this maneuver.

The initial speed of the vehicle is 72 km/h (20 m/s). Let's break down the trajectory step by step for each second until the maneuver is completed.

### Key Details:
- Initial position: (0, 0)
- Obstacle position: (100, 0)
- Left lane Y-coordinate: Y = -5
- Right lane Y-coordinate: Y = 0
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- Initial speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s)

We will use a combination of constant longitudinal motion (X-direction) and controlled lateral motion (Y-direction) to achieve the desired path.

### Trajectory Plan:

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change to Left Lane (T = 0 to T = 4 seconds)**
- Start moving laterally to the left lane while maintaining the longitudinal speed.
- Gradually decrease the lateral speed as you approach the left lane.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y)       |
|----------|-----------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)               |
| 1        | (20, -1.25)          |
| 2        | (40, -2.5)           |
| 3        | (60, -3.75)          |
| 4        | (80, -5)             |

At T = 4 seconds, the vehicle is fully in the left lane (Y = -5) and has traveled 80 meters longitudinally.

---

#### **Phase 2: Overtake the Obstacle (T = 4 to T = 6 seconds)**
- Continue driving straight in the left lane at a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h).
- Ensure that the vehicle passes the obstacle (X = 100) while staying in the left lane.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y)       |
|----------|-----------------------|
| 5        | (100, -5)             |
| 6        | (120, -5)             |

At T = 6 seconds, the vehicle has overtaken the obstacle and is still in the left lane.

---

#### **Phase 3: Lane Change Back to Right Lane (T = 6 to T = 9 seconds)**
- Begin moving laterally back to the right lane while maintaining the longitudinal speed.
- Gradually decrease the lateral speed as you approach the right lane.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y)       |
|----------|-----------------------|
| 7        | (140, -3.75)         |
| 8        | (160, -2.5)          |
| 9        | (180, -1.25)         |

At T = 9 seconds, the vehicle is almost back in the right lane.

---

#### **Phase 4: Finalize Lane Change (T = 9 to T = 10 seconds)**
- Complete the lane change back to the right lane (Y = 0).

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y)       |
|----------|-----------------------|
| 10       | (200, 0)              |

At T = 10 seconds, the vehicle has successfully returned to the right lane and is driving safely ahead.

---

### Summary of Trajectory:
- From T = 0 to T = 4: Move to the left lane.
- From T = 4 to T = 6: Overtake the obstacle in the left lane.
- From T = 6 to T = 10: Return to the right lane.

This trajectory ensures safe navigation around the obstacle while maintaining the required highway speed.
