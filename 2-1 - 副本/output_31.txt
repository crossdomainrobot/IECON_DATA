To safely execute the double-lane change maneuver while adhering to highway speed limits, we will plan a smooth trajectory that transitions from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -5), passes the obstacle at X = 100, and then transitions back to the right lane. The vehicle's initial velocity is 72 km/h (or 20 m/s). We will ensure the vehicle remains above 60 km/h (or approximately 16.67 m/s) throughout the maneuver.

### **Step-by-Step Trajectory Plan**
We will calculate the vehicle's position at each second (T = 1, 2, ..., until the maneuver finishes). The trajectory will involve three phases:
1. **Lane Change to Left Lane**: Gradually transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
2. **Pass Obstacle in Left Lane**: Maintain Y = -5 while passing X = 100.
3. **Lane Change Back to Right Lane**: Gradually transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0.

The vehicle will maintain a constant longitudinal velocity of 20 m/s during the maneuver unless otherwise specified.

### **Trajectory Calculation**

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change to Left Lane**
- Start at (X, Y) = (0, 0).
- Gradually decrease Y from 0 to -5 over the first 5 seconds.
- During this time, X increases linearly at 20 m/s.

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -1    |
| 2        | 40    | -2    |
| 3        | 60    | -3    |
| 4        | 80    | -4    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |

At T = 5, the vehicle has successfully transitioned to the left lane (Y = -5) and is aligned with the obstacle at X = 100.

---

#### **Phase 2: Pass Obstacle in Left Lane**
- Maintain Y = -5 while continuing forward at 20 m/s.
- Pass the obstacle at X = 100.

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -5    |
| 8        | 160   | -5    |

At T = 8, the vehicle has passed the obstacle and is ready to transition back to the right lane.

---

#### **Phase 3: Lane Change Back to Right Lane**
- Gradually increase Y from -5 to 0 over the next 5 seconds.
- Continue moving forward at 20 m/s.

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 9        | 180   | -4    |
| 10       | 200   | -3    |
| 11       | 220   | -2    |
| 12       | 240   | -1    |
| 13       | 260   | 0     |

At T = 13, the vehicle has completed the double-lane change maneuver and returned to the right lane (Y = 0).

---

### **Final Trajectory Summary**

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -1    |
| 2        | 40    | -2    |
| 3        | 60    | -3    |
| 4        | 80    | -4    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -5    |
| 8        | 160   | -5    |
| 9        | 180   | -4    |
| 10       | 200   | -3    |
| 11       | 220   | -2    |
| 12       | 240   | -1    |
| 13       | 260   | 0     |

This trajectory ensures the vehicle safely avoids the obstacle, maintains highway speeds, and smoothly transitions between lanes.
