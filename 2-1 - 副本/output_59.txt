To safely navigate the double lane change maneuver, we need to ensure that the vehicle smoothly transitions from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -5), passes the obstacle at X = 100, and then returns to the right lane. The vehicle must maintain a speed of at least 60 km/h (approximately 16.67 m/s). Below is a detailed trajectory plan for the next 10 seconds.

### **Initial Setup**
- Initial position: (0, 0)
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s
- Lane width: 5 meters (right lane Y = 0, left lane Y = -5)

---

### **Trajectory Plan**

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change to Left Lane (T = 0 to T = 3)**
- Gradually decrease Y from 0 to -5 while maintaining a forward speed of approximately 20 m/s.
- At T = 3, the vehicle should be fully in the left lane (Y = -5).

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -1.67)     |
| 2        | (40, -3.33)     |
| 3        | (60, -5)        |

---

#### **Phase 2: Maintain Left Lane and Approach Obstacle (T = 3 to T = 5)**
- Continue driving straight in the left lane (Y = -5) while approaching the obstacle at X = 100.
- Maintain a speed of approximately 20 m/s.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 4        | (80, -5)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |

---

#### **Phase 3: Lane Change Back to Right Lane (T = 5 to T = 8)**
- Gradually increase Y from -5 to 0 while passing the obstacle and continuing forward.
- At T = 8, the vehicle should be fully back in the right lane (Y = 0).

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 6        | (120, -3.33)    |
| 7        | (140, -1.67)    |
| 8        | (160, 0)        |

---

#### **Phase 4: Continue Driving in Right Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)**
- Drive straight in the right lane (Y = 0) while maintaining a speed of approximately 20 m/s.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 9        | (180, 0)        |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

### **Summary of Trajectory**
The vehicle successfully performs the double lane change maneuver as follows:
1. Moves from the right lane to the left lane over the first 3 seconds.
2. Passes the obstacle at X = 100 while staying in the left lane.
3. Returns to the right lane over the next 3 seconds.
4. Continues driving in the right lane afterward.

This trajectory ensures safety, smoothness, and compliance with highway speed regulations.
