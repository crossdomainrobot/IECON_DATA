To safely navigate the obstacle, we need to plan a trajectory that smoothly transitions from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -5), pass the obstacle at X = 100, and then transition back to the right lane. The vehicle must maintain a speed of at least 60 km/h (16.67 m/s). Below is the planned trajectory for the next 10 seconds.

### Key Assumptions:
1. **Initial Speed**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
2. **Lateral Movement**: Smoothly change lanes using a sinusoidal-like path to avoid abrupt movements.
3. **Longitudinal Movement**: Maintain a constant speed of 20 m/s unless slowing down is necessary for safety.

### Trajectory Plan:
#### Phase 1: Transition to the Left Lane (T = 0 to T = 4)
- Start moving laterally toward the left lane while maintaining longitudinal progress.
- At T = 4, fully transition to the left lane (Y = -5).

#### Phase 2: Pass the Obstacle (T = 4 to T = 6)
- Remain in the left lane (Y = -5) and continue forward to pass the obstacle at X = 100.

#### Phase 3: Transition Back to the Right Lane (T = 6 to T = 10)
- Gradually move back to the right lane (Y = 0) while continuing forward.

### Explanation of Lateral Movement:
The lateral movement (Y-coordinate) follows a smooth transition based on a sinusoidal-like function:
$$
Y(T) = -5 \cdot \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} \cdot T\right) \quad \text{for } 0 \leq T \leq 4
$$
$$
Y(T) = -5 + 5 \cdot \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} \cdot (T - 6)\right) \quad \text{for } 6 \leq T \leq 10
$$

This ensures a gradual and safe lane change without abrupt maneuvers.

### Longitudinal Movement:
The longitudinal position (X-coordinate) increases linearly with time:
$$
X(T) = 20 \cdot T
$$
since the vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s during the maneuver.

By following this trajectory, the vehicle safely transitions to the left lane, passes the obstacle, and returns to the right lane while adhering to highway speed regulations.
