To safely execute the double lane change maneuver while adhering to the highway speed limit and avoiding the obstacle, we need to carefully plan the trajectory. Below is a step-by-step trajectory for the vehicle's position over time:

### Key Assumptions:
1. The vehicle's initial speed is 72 km/h (20 m/s).
2. The vehicle must stay above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s) during the maneuver.
3. A smooth transition is required for lateral movement (Y-axis) to avoid abrupt changes.

### Trajectory Plan:
- **Initial Position**: (0, 0)
- **Obstacle Location**: (100, 0)
- **Left Lane Y-coordinate**: -5

We will calculate the vehicle's position at each second (T = 1, 2, ..., until the maneuver finishes).

---

#### **Time T = 0**
- Position: (0, 0)
- Speed: 20 m/s (along X-axis)

---

#### **Time T = 1**
- Begin moving slightly toward the left lane.
- Lateral velocity component: 1 m/s (to smoothly shift lanes).
- Longitudinal velocity: 19.9 m/s (slightly reduced to accommodate lateral motion).
- Position: (19.9, -1)

---

#### **Time T = 2**
- Continue shifting left.
- Lateral velocity: 1 m/s.
- Longitudinal velocity: 19.8 m/s.
- Position: (39.7, -2)

---

#### **Time T = 3**
- Continue shifting left.
- Lateral velocity: 1 m/s.
- Longitudinal velocity: 19.7 m/s.
- Position: (59.4, -3)

---

#### **Time T = 4**
- Complete the lane change into the left lane.
- Lateral velocity: 1 m/s.
- Longitudinal velocity: 19.6 m/s.
- Position: (79.0, -4)

---

#### **Time T = 5**
- Fully in the left lane.
- Lateral velocity: 0 m/s.
- Longitudinal velocity: 20 m/s (return to original speed).
- Position: (99.0, -5)

---

#### **Time T = 6**
- Passing the obstacle (X = 100).
- Stay in the left lane.
- Longitudinal velocity: 20 m/s.
- Position: (119.0, -5)

---

#### **Time T = 7**
- Continuing past the obstacle.
- Longitudinal velocity: 20 m/s.
- Position: (139.0, -5)

---

#### **Time T = 8**
- Begin shifting back to the right lane.
- Lateral velocity: 1 m/s (toward Y = 0).
- Longitudinal velocity: 19.9 m/s.
- Position: (158.9, -4)

---

#### **Time T = 9**
- Continue shifting back to the right lane.
- Lateral velocity: 1 m/s.
- Longitudinal velocity: 19.8 m/s.
- Position: (178.7, -3)

---

#### **Time T = 10**
- Complete the shift back to the right lane.
- Lateral velocity: 1 m/s.
- Longitudinal velocity: 19.7 m/s.
- Position: (198.4, -2)

---

#### **Time T = 11**
- Fully back in the right lane.
- Lateral velocity: 0 m/s.
- Longitudinal velocity: 20 m/s (return to original speed).
- Position: (218.1, 0)

---

### Final Maneuver Summary:
- At **T = 5**, the vehicle passes the obstacle at (100, -5), fully in the left lane.
- By **T = 11**, the vehicle has completed the double lane change and returned to the right lane.

This trajectory ensures safe passage of the obstacle while maintaining highway speed requirements and smooth lateral transitions.
