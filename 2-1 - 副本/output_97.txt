To safely execute the double lane change maneuver while maintaining highway speed, we need to plan a smooth trajectory that avoids the obstacle at $X = 100$ and ensures the vehicle stays within the legal speed range (above 60 km/h). Below is the detailed trajectory for the next 10 seconds, assuming the initial position is $(0, 0)$ and the vehicle's initial velocity is 72 km/h ($20 \, \text{m/s}$).

### **Step-by-Step Trajectory Planning**

#### **Initial Conditions**
- Initial position: $(0, 0)$
- Initial velocity: $v = 20 \, \text{m/s}$
- Lane width: $Y = -5$ for the left lane, $Y = 0$ for the right lane.
- Obstacle location: $(100, 0)$

#### **Trajectory Plan**
The maneuver involves:
1. Gradually moving from the right lane ($Y = 0$) to the left lane ($Y = -5$).
2. Passing the obstacle at $X = 100$ while staying in the left lane.
3. Returning to the right lane after passing the obstacle.

We will use a smooth lateral transition with constant longitudinal velocity ($v_x = 20 \, \text{m/s}$) to ensure safety and compliance with highway speed limits.

### **Position at Each Timepoint**

| **Time (T)** | **Position (X, Y)** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------------|----------------|
| $T = 0$      | $(0, 0)$            | Starting position in the right lane. |
| $T = 1$      | $(20, -0.5)$        | Begin lateral transition to the left lane. |
| $T = 2$      | $(40, -1.5)$        | Continue lateral transition. |
| $T = 3$      | $(60, -3.0)$        | Midway through the lane change. |
| $T = 4$      | $(80, -4.5)$        | Approaching the left lane. |
| $T = 5$      | $(100, -5.0)$       | Fully in the left lane, passing the obstacle at $X = 100$. |
| $T = 6$      | $(120, -5.0)$       | Still in the left lane, past the obstacle. |
| $T = 7$      | $(140, -4.5)$       | Begin transitioning back to the right lane. |
| $T = 8$      | $(160, -3.0)$       | Continuing the return to the right lane. |
| $T = 9$      | $(180, -1.5)$       | Nearly back in the right lane. |
| $T = 10$     | $(200, 0.0)$        | Fully returned to the right lane. |

### **Explanation of the Maneuver**
1. **Lateral Transition (T = 0 to T = 5):**
   - The vehicle smoothly transitions from $Y = 0$ to $Y = -5$ over 5 seconds.
   - This ensures the vehicle is fully in the left lane by the time it reaches $X = 100$, avoiding the obstacle.

2. **Passing the Obstacle (T = 5):**
   - At $X = 100$, the vehicle is fully in the left lane ($Y = -5$), safely bypassing the stopped vehicle.

3. **Returning to the Right Lane (T = 6 to T = 10):**
   - After passing the obstacle, the vehicle gradually transitions back to the right lane ($Y = 0$).
   - By $T = 10$, the vehicle is fully back in the right lane.

4. **Longitudinal Motion:**
   - The vehicle maintains a constant longitudinal velocity of $20 \, \text{m/s}$ (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver, ensuring compliance with highway speed requirements.
