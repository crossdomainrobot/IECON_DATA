To safely navigate the double lane change maneuver, we need to ensure the vehicle smoothly transitions from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -5), passes the obstacle at X = 100 while staying in the left lane, and then switches back to the right lane. The vehicle must also maintain a speed of over 60 km/h (approximately 16.67 m/s).

Below is the planned trajectory for the next 10 seconds:

---

### **Initial Setup:**
- Initial position: (0, 0)
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s
- Obstacle location: (100, 0)

---

### **Trajectory Plan:**

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change to Left Lane (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)**
The vehicle will gradually move from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -5) while maintaining a constant longitudinal speed of 20 m/s.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y)   |
|----------|-------------------|
| T = 0    | (0, 0)           |
| T = 1    | (20, -1.67)      |
| T = 2    | (40, -3.33)      |
| T = 3    | (60, -5)         |

At T = 3 seconds, the vehicle has fully transitioned into the left lane (Y = -5).

---

#### **Phase 2: Maintain Left Lane and Pass Obstacle (T = 3 to T = 7 seconds)**
The vehicle continues driving in the left lane (Y = -5) at a constant speed of 20 m/s to pass the obstacle at X = 100.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y)   |
|----------|-------------------|
| T = 3    | (60, -5)         |
| T = 4    | (80, -5)         |
| T = 5    | (100, -5)        |
| T = 6    | (120, -5)        |
| T = 7    | (140, -5)        |

At T = 5 seconds, the vehicle successfully passes the obstacle at X = 100 while remaining in the left lane.

---

#### **Phase 3: Lane Change Back to Right Lane (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds)**
The vehicle gradually moves back to the right lane (Y = 0) while continuing at a constant longitudinal speed of 20 m/s.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y)   |
|----------|-------------------|
| T = 7    | (140, -5)        |
| T = 8    | (160, -3.33)     |
| T = 9    | (180, -1.67)     |
| T = 10   | (200, 0)         |

At T = 10 seconds, the vehicle has completed the double lane change maneuver and returned to the right lane (Y = 0).

---

### **Summary of Trajectory:**
- At T = 3 seconds, the vehicle transitions into the left lane.
- At T = 5 seconds, the vehicle passes the obstacle at X = 100 while in the left lane.
- At T = 10 seconds, the vehicle returns to the right lane after safely passing the obstacle.

This trajectory ensures the vehicle maintains a safe speed and avoids the obstacle while performing smooth lane changes.
