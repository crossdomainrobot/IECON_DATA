To safely execute the double lane change maneuver while maintaining highway speed, we will plan a trajectory that ensures smooth transitions between lanes and adherence to the speed constraints. Below is the planned trajectory for the next 10 seconds:

### **Initial Conditions**
- Initial position: (0, 0)
- Obstacle position: (100, 0)
- Left lane Y-coordinate: -5
- Initial speed: 72 km/h = 20 m/s
- Minimum speed on the highway: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s

We will perform the following steps:
1. Gradually move into the left lane starting at T = 0.
2. Pass the obstacle in the left lane around X = 100.
3. Gradually return to the right lane after passing the obstacle.

### **Trajectory Plan**

#### **T = 0**
- Position: (0, 0)
- Speed: 20 m/s

#### **T = 1**
- Position: (20, -1)  
  *Explanation*: Start moving slightly to the left lane while maintaining forward motion.

#### **T = 2**
- Position: (40, -2)  
  *Explanation*: Continue transitioning to the left lane.

#### **T = 3**
- Position: (60, -3)  
  *Explanation*: Progressively move toward the left lane.

#### **T = 4**
- Position: (80, -4)  
  *Explanation*: Almost fully in the left lane.

#### **T = 5**
- Position: (100, -5)  
  *Explanation*: Fully in the left lane, passing the obstacle safely.

#### **T = 6**
- Position: (120, -5)  
  *Explanation*: Continue driving in the left lane after passing the obstacle.

#### **T = 7**
- Position: (140, -4)  
  *Explanation*: Begin transitioning back to the right lane.

#### **T = 8**
- Position: (160, -3)  
  *Explanation*: Gradually move closer to the right lane.

#### **T = 9**
- Position: (180, -2)  
  *Explanation*: Further transition back to the right lane.

#### **T = 10**
- Position: (200, 0)  
  *Explanation*: Successfully returned to the right lane.

### **Summary of Key Points**
- At **T = 5**, the vehicle is fully in the left lane (-5) and passes the obstacle at X = 100.
- The vehicle maintains a speed greater than 60 km/h throughout the maneuver.
- Smooth transitions are ensured by gradually changing the lateral position (Y).

This trajectory ensures safety and compliance with highway driving rules.
