To plan a safe trajectory for the vehicle to perform a double lane change maneuver while maintaining highway speed, we need to carefully adjust the lateral (Y) and longitudinal (X) positions. Below is a step-by-step plan of the vehicle's position at each second (T = 1, 2, ..., until the maneuver finishes). 

### Assumptions:
1. The initial velocity of the vehicle is **72 km/h** (or approximately **20 m/s**).
2. The vehicle must stay above **60 km/h** (or approximately **16.67 m/s**) throughout the maneuver.
3. The left lane has a Y-coordinate of **-5**, and the right lane has a Y-coordinate of **0**.
4. The obstacle is located at **(100, 0)**.

### Trajectory Plan:

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change to Left Lane**
The vehicle starts moving toward the left lane by gradually adjusting its lateral position (Y).

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) | Explanation |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          | Initial position in the right lane. |
| 1        | (20, -1)        | Begin moving laterally into the left lane while maintaining longitudinal speed. |
| 2        | (40, -2)        | Continue lateral movement. |
| 3        | (60, -3)        | Further adjust the lateral position. |
| 4        | (80, -4)        | Approaching the left lane. |
| 5        | (100, -5)       | Fully in the left lane, ready to pass the obstacle. |

At T = 5 seconds, the vehicle is fully in the left lane (**Y = -5**) and aligned with the obstacle (**X = 100**).

---

#### **Phase 2: Passing the Obstacle**
The vehicle continues driving straight in the left lane, maintaining its longitudinal speed.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) | Explanation |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| 6        | (120, -5)       | Moving past the obstacle in the left lane. |
| 7        | (140, -5)       | Continuing in the left lane. |
| 8        | (160, -5)       | Safe distance from the obstacle. |

At T = 8 seconds, the vehicle is safely past the obstacle and ready to return to the right lane.

---

#### **Phase 3: Lane Change Back to Right Lane**
The vehicle begins moving back to the right lane by gradually adjusting its lateral position (Y).

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) | Explanation |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| 9        | (180, -4)       | Starting to move laterally back to the right lane. |
| 10       | (200, -3)       | Continuing lateral movement. |
| 11       | (220, -2)       | Further adjusting the lateral position. |
| 12       | (240, -1)       | Approaching the right lane. |
| 13       | (260, 0)        | Fully back in the right lane. |

At T = 13 seconds, the vehicle has completed the double lane change maneuver and returned to the right lane (**Y = 0**).

### Final Trajectory Summary:
Here¡¯s the complete trajectory for the vehicle:

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -1)        |
| 2        | (40, -2)        |
| 3        | (60, -3)        |
| 4        | (80, -4)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -5)       |
| 7        | (140, -5)       |
| 8        | (160, -5)       |
| 9        | (180, -4)       |
| 10       | (200, -3)       |
| 11       | (220, -2)       |
| 12       | (240, -1)       |
| 13       | (260, 0)        |

This trajectory ensures that the vehicle:
1. Safely changes lanes to avoid the obstacle.
2. Maintains a speed of over 60 km/h throughout the maneuver.
3. Returns to the original lane after passing the obstacle.
