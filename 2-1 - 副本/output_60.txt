To safely perform the double lane change maneuver while maintaining a velocity above 60 km/h, we need to plan a smooth and safe trajectory. Below is a detailed trajectory for the vehicle's position at each second (T = 1, 2, ..., until the maneuver finishes). The initial speed of 72 km/h is approximately **20 m/s**, and we'll ensure that the lateral movement into the left lane and back is gradual and safe.

### Initial Conditions:
- Initial position: (0, 0)
- Obstacle position: (100, 0)
- Left lane Y-coordinate: -5
- Minimum speed: > 60 km/h (~16.67 m/s)

---

### Trajectory Plan:

#### Phase 1: Start Lane Change to the Left Lane (T = 0 to T = 3)
- Gradually move laterally from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
- Maintain longitudinal speed at ~20 m/s.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -1.67)     |
| 2        | (40, -3.33)     |
| 3        | (60, -5)        |

At T = 3, the vehicle is fully in the left lane (Y = -5).

---

#### Phase 2: Pass the Obstacle in the Left Lane (T = 3 to T = 6)
- Continue driving straight in the left lane at ~20 m/s.
- Ensure X reaches 100 before starting the lane change back.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 3        | (60, -5)         |
| 4        | (80, -5)         |
| 5        | (100, -5)        |
| 6        | (120, -5)        |

At T = 5, the vehicle has passed the obstacle (X = 100).

---

#### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Right Lane (T = 6 to T = 9)
- Gradually move laterally from Y = -5 back to Y = 0.
- Maintain longitudinal speed at ~20 m/s.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 6        | (120, -5)        |
| 7        | (140, -3.33)     |
| 8        | (160, -1.67)     |
| 9        | (180, 0)         |

At T = 9, the vehicle is back in the right lane (Y = 0).

---

### Final Trajectory Summary:
Here¡¯s the complete trajectory for the vehicle over the next 10 seconds:

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -1.67)     |
| 2        | (40, -3.33)     |
| 3        | (60, -5)        |
| 4        | (80, -5)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -5)       |
| 7        | (140, -3.33)    |
| 8        | (160, -1.67)    |
| 9        | (180, 0)        |

### Key Points:
1. The vehicle smoothly transitions into the left lane by T = 3.
2. It passes the obstacle (X = 100) safely in the left lane by T = 5.
3. It transitions back to the right lane by T = 9.
4. Throughout the maneuver, the longitudinal speed remains above 60 km/h (~16.67 m/s). 

This trajectory ensures safety and compliance with highway driving rules.
