To safely navigate the double lane change maneuver, we need to plan a smooth trajectory that ensures the vehicle transitions from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -5), passes the obstacle at X = 100, and then returns to the right lane. The vehicle must maintain a speed of at least 60 km/h throughout the maneuver.

### Step 1: Convert Speed to Meters Per Second
The initial speed is 72 km/h, which converts to:
$$
72 \, \text{km/h} = \frac{72 \times 1000}{3600} = 20 \, \text{m/s}.
$$

We will assume the vehicle maintains this speed during the maneuver.

### Step 2: Define the Trajectory
The trajectory will involve three phases:
1. **Lane Change to Left Lane**: Gradually move from Y = 0 to Y = -5 while continuing forward.
2. **Pass the Obstacle**: Stay in the left lane (Y = -5) as the vehicle reaches X = 100.
3. **Lane Change Back to Right Lane**: Gradually return from Y = -5 to Y = 0 after passing the obstacle.

### Step 3: Plan the Path
We will calculate the position (X, Y) at each second for the next 10 seconds. The vehicle starts at (0, 0) at T = 0.

#### Phase 1: Lane Change to Left Lane (T = 0 to T = 5)
- Move from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 5 seconds.
- Simultaneously, continue moving forward at 20 m/s along the X-axis.

At each second:
$$
Y(T) = -T \quad \text{(for T = 0 to 5)}.
$$
$$
X(T) = 20 \times T.
$$

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -1    |
| 2        | 40    | -2    |
| 3        | 60    | -3    |
| 4        | 80    | -4    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |

#### Phase 2: Pass the Obstacle (T = 5 to T = 6)
- Remain in the left lane (Y = -5).
- Continue moving forward at 20 m/s along the X-axis.

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |

#### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to Right Lane (T = 6 to T = 10)
- Gradually move from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 4 seconds.
- Continue moving forward at 20 m/s along the X-axis.

At each second:
$$
Y(T) = -5 + (T - 6) \quad \text{(for T = 6 to 10)}.
$$
$$
X(T) = 20 \times T.
$$

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -4    |
| 8        | 160   | -3    |
| 9        | 180   | -2    |
| 10       | 200   | -1    |

### Final Answer: Positions Over the Next 10 Seconds
$$
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Time (T)} & \text{X (m)} & \text{Y (m)} \\
&0 & 0 & 0 \\
&1 & 20 & -1 \\
&2 & 40 & -2 \\
&3 & 60 & -3 \\
&4 & 80 & -4 \\
&5 & 100 & -5 \\
&6 & 120 & -5 \\
&7 & 140 & -4 \\
&8 & 160 & -3 \\
&9 & 180 & -2 \\
&10 & 200 & -1 \\
\end{aligned}
}
$$

By following this trajectory, the vehicle safely changes lanes, passes the obstacle, and returns to the right lane while maintaining highway speeds.
