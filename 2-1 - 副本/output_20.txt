To safely execute the double lane change maneuver while maintaining a velocity of over 60 km/h, we need to plan a smooth trajectory that avoids abrupt changes in speed or direction. Below is the step-by-step trajectory for the next 10 seconds and beyond until the maneuver is completed.

### Key Details:
- Initial speed: **72 km/h = 20 m/s**
- Minimum speed on highway: **60 km/h = 16.67 m/s**
- Obstacle location: **(100, 0)**
- Left lane Y-coordinate: **Y = -5**
- Right lane Y-coordinate: **Y = 0**

---

### Trajectory Plan:

#### Phase 1: Begin Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 3)
In this phase, the vehicle starts moving from the right lane (Y = 0) toward the left lane (Y = -5). The lateral movement should be gradual to ensure safety and comfort.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -1.67)     |
| 2        | (40, -3.33)     |
| 3        | (60, -5)        |

**Explanation**: 
- At T = 0, the vehicle is at (0, 0).
- By T = 3, the vehicle has moved 60 meters forward along the X-axis and fully transitioned into the left lane (Y = -5).

---

#### Phase 2: Maintain Speed in Left Lane (T = 3 to T = 7)
In this phase, the vehicle continues driving straight in the left lane at a constant speed of 20 m/s to safely pass the obstacle at X = 100.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 3        | (60, -5)        |
| 4        | (80, -5)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -5)       |
| 7        | (140, -5)       |

**Explanation**:
- From T = 3 to T = 7, the vehicle travels at 20 m/s along the left lane (Y = -5).
- At T = 5, the vehicle safely passes the obstacle located at (100, 0).

---

#### Phase 3: Return to Right Lane (T = 7 to T = 9)
In this phase, the vehicle transitions back to the right lane (Y = 0) after passing the obstacle.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 7        | (140, -5)       |
| 8        | (160, -3.33)    |
| 9        | (180, -1.67)    |

**Explanation**:
- Starting at T = 7, the vehicle begins moving laterally back toward the right lane.
- By T = 9, the vehicle is halfway through the transition.

---

#### Phase 4: Complete Lane Change Back to Right Lane (T = 9 to T = 10)
In this final phase, the vehicle completes its return to the right lane.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 9        | (180, -1.67)    |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

**Explanation**:
- By T = 10, the vehicle has returned to the right lane (Y = 0) and is now traveling at 20 m/s.

### Final Trajectory Summary:
The vehicle successfully executes the double lane change maneuver while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h. Here¡¯s the complete trajectory:

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -1.67)     |
| 2        | (40, -3.33)     |
| 3        | (60, -5)        |
| 4        | (80, -5)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -5)       |
| 7        | (140, -5)       |
| 8        | (160, -3.33)    |
| 9        | (180, -1.67)    |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

This trajectory ensures a safe and smooth passage around the obstacle while adhering to highway speed requirements.
