To safely perform the double-lane change maneuver while maintaining a speed of at least 60 km/h, we need to plan a smooth trajectory that ensures the vehicle transitions from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -5), overtakes the obstacle at X = 100, and then switches back to the right lane. Here's how the trajectory will unfold over time:

### **Key Assumptions:**
1. The initial speed is 72 km/h (20 m/s).
2. The vehicle must maintain a speed of at least 60 km/h (16.67 m/s) during the maneuver.
3. The lateral movement (Y-axis) will be gradual to ensure safety and stability.

### **Trajectory Plan**

#### **Initial Position (T = 0):**
- Starting position: (0, 0)
- Speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s)

#### **Step-by-Step Trajectory:**

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y)         | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| T = 1    | (20, -0.5)              | Begin moving slightly to the left while continuing forward at 20 m/s.          |
| T = 2    | (40, -1.5)              | Continue transitioning to the left lane while maintaining forward speed.         |
| T = 3    | (60, -3.0)              | Progressively move further into the left lane.                                |
| T = 4    | (80, -5.0)              | Fully in the left lane (Y = -5) just before reaching the obstacle.            |
| T = 5    | (100, -5.0)             | Overtake the obstacle while staying in the left lane.                         |
| T = 6    | (120, -5.0)             | Continue driving in the left lane after passing the obstacle.                 |
| T = 7    | (140, -4.0)             | Start transitioning back to the right lane while maintaining forward speed.     |
| T = 8    | (160, -2.5)             | Gradually move closer to the right lane.                                     |
| T = 9    | (180, -1.0)             | Almost back in the right lane.                                               |
| T = 10   | (200, 0.0)              | Fully back in the right lane, completing the maneuver.                         |

### **Detailed Analysis of the Maneuver:**

1. **Lateral Movement (Y-axis):**
   - From T = 0 to T = 4, the vehicle smoothly transitions from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -5).
   - At T = 5, the vehicle passes the obstacle while fully in the left lane.
   - From T = 6 to T = 10, the vehicle transitions back to the right lane.

2. **Longitudinal Movement (X-axis):**
   - The vehicle maintains a constant longitudinal speed of approximately 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
   - By T = 5, the vehicle has reached X = 100, successfully overtaking the obstacle.

3. **Safety Considerations:**
   - The lateral movement is gradual to avoid abrupt steering inputs.
   - The vehicle remains above the minimum speed requirement of 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).

### **Final Answer:**
The trajectory for the next 10 seconds is as follows:

- T = 1: (20, -0.5)
- T = 2: (40, -1.5)
- T = 3: (60, -3.0)
- T = 4: (80, -5.0)
- T = 5: (100, -5.0)
- T = 6: (120, -5.0)
- T = 7: (140, -4.0)
- T = 8: (160, -2.5)
- T = 9: (180, -1.0)
- T = 10: (200, 0.0)

This path ensures a safe and smooth overtaking maneuver while adhering to highway speed regulations.
