To safely navigate the obstacle and complete the double lane change maneuver, we need to plan a smooth trajectory that adheres to the following constraints:

1. **Maintain highway speed**: The vehicle must stay above 60 km/h (approximately 16.7 m/s).
2. **Avoid collision**: Ensure the vehicle is in the left lane (Y = -5) when passing the obstacle at X = 100.
3. **Smooth transition**: Gradually change lanes to minimize discomfort for passengers.

### Step-by-Step Trajectory Planning

#### Initial Conditions:
- Initial position: (X=0, Y=0)
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s
- Lane width: 5 meters (right lane Y=0, left lane Y=-5)

We will use a combination of constant longitudinal velocity (to maintain speed) and controlled lateral movement (to change lanes). Below is the planned trajectory for the next 10 seconds.

| T = 3        | (60, -3)                    | (20, -1)          |

| T = 6        | (120, -4.5)                 | (20, 1)           |
| T = 7        | (140, -3)                   | (20, 1)           |
| T = 8        | (160, -1.5)                 | (20, 1)           |
| T = 9        | (180, -0.5)                 | (20, 1)           |

### Explanation of the Maneuver:

1. **Initial Phase (T = 0 to T = 4):**
   - The vehicle starts at (0, 0) with an initial velocity of 20 m/s along the X-axis.
   - A gradual lateral movement begins at T = 1, shifting the vehicle from Y = 0 to Y = -5 by T = 5.
   - The lateral velocity is set to -1 m/s to smoothly transition into the left lane.

2. **Lane Change Completion (T = 5):**
   - By T = 5, the vehicle reaches the obstacle at X = 100 and fully transitions to the left lane (Y = -5).

3. **Passing the Obstacle (T = 5):**
   - The vehicle maintains its longitudinal velocity of 20 m/s while staying in the left lane.

4. **Returning to the Right Lane (T = 6 to T = 10):**
   - Starting at T = 6, the vehicle gradually shifts back to the right lane with a lateral velocity of +1 m/s.
   - By T = 10, the vehicle completes the maneuver and returns to the right lane at (200, 0).

### Key Notes:
- The longitudinal velocity remains constant at 20 m/s throughout the maneuver to comply with highway speed regulations.
- The lateral velocity is kept low (-1 m/s or +1 m/s) to ensure a smooth and safe lane change.
- The vehicle stays in the left lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstacle at X = 100.

This trajectory ensures a safe and efficient double lane change maneuver while adhering to highway driving rules.
