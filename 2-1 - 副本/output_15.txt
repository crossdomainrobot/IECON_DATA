To plan a safe and smooth trajectory for the double lane change maneuver, we need to ensure that the vehicle stays within the speed limit (over 60 km/h) while avoiding the obstacle at (100, 0). The trajectory will involve transitioning from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -5), passing the obstacle, and then transitioning back to the right lane.

The initial speed of the vehicle is 72 km/h, which converts to approximately **20 m/s**. We'll use this as the longitudinal velocity (X-axis velocity) during the maneuver. For simplicity, let's assume the lateral movement (Y-axis) involves controlled acceleration and deceleration to smoothly transition between lanes.

Here¡¯s the detailed trajectory:

### **Step-by-Step Trajectory**
We will calculate the position (X, Y) every second until the maneuver is complete.

#### **Initial Conditions:**
- Initial position: (0, 0)
- Initial velocity: 20 m/s along X-axis
- Lane width: 5 meters (distance between Y = 0 and Y = -5)

---

### **Phase 1: Transition to Left Lane (T = 0 to T = 5 seconds)**

1. **T = 0:**  
   Position: (0, 0)  
   Velocity: (20 m/s, 0 m/s)  

2. **T = 1:**  
   Start moving laterally toward the left lane.  
   Position: (20, -1)  
   Velocity: (20 m/s, -2 m/s)  

3. **T = 2:**  
   Continue moving laterally.  
   Position: (40, -2)  
   Velocity: (20 m/s, -2 m/s)  

4. **T = 3:**  
   Keep transitioning to the left lane.  
   Position: (60, -3)  
   Velocity: (20 m/s, -2 m/s)  

5. **T = 4:**  
   Almost fully in the left lane.  
   Position: (80, -4)  
   Velocity: (20 m/s, -2 m/s)  

6. **T = 5:**  
   Fully in the left lane.  
   Position: (100, -5)  
   Velocity: (20 m/s, 0 m/s)  

At this point, the vehicle has successfully transitioned to the left lane and is now aligned with the obstacle at X = 100.

---

### **Phase 2: Pass the Obstacle (T = 6 to T = 9 seconds)**

7. **T = 6:**  
   Continue driving in the left lane.  
   Position: (120, -5)  
   Velocity: (20 m/s, 0 m/s)  

8. **T = 7:**  
   Still in the left lane, safely passing the obstacle.  
   Position: (140, -5)  
   Velocity: (20 m/s, 0 m/s)  

9. **T = 8:**  
   Continuing to drive in the left lane.  
   Position: (160, -5)  
   Velocity: (20 m/s, 0 m/s)  

10. **T = 9:**  
    Moving further away from the obstacle.  
    Position: (180, -5)  
    Velocity: (20 m/s, 0 m/s)  

---

### **Phase 3: Transition Back to Right Lane (T = 10 to T = 14 seconds)**

11. **T = 10:**  
    Start transitioning back to the right lane.  
    Position: (200, -4)  
    Velocity: (20 m/s, 2 m/s)  

12. **T = 11:**  
    Continue moving laterally toward the right lane.  
    Position: (220, -3)  
    Velocity: (20 m/s, 2 m/s)  

13. **T = 12:**  
    Keep transitioning to the right lane.  
    Position: (240, -2)  
    Velocity: (20 m/s, 2 m/s)  

14. **T = 13:**  
    Almost fully in the right lane.  
    Position: (260, -1)  
    Velocity: (20 m/s, 2 m/s)  

15. **T = 14:**  
    Fully back in the right lane.  
    Position: (280, 0)  
    Velocity: (20 m/s, 0 m/s)

### **Summary of Key Points**
- At **T = 5**, the vehicle transitions into the left lane at (100, -5).
- From **T = 6 to T = 9**, the vehicle safely passes the obstacle while staying in the left lane.
- By **T = 14**, the vehicle completes the maneuver and returns to the right lane at (280, 0).

This trajectory ensures safety, compliance with highway speed limits, and smooth transitions between lanes. 

**Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{\text{The vehicle follows the described trajectory to safely pass the obstacle and return to the right lane.}}
