To safely navigate the obstacle, we need to plan a smooth trajectory that involves changing lanes, overtaking the stopped vehicle, and returning to the original lane. Here's a step-by-step description of the vehicle's position over time, ensuring the speed remains above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s) throughout the maneuver.

### Initial Parameters:
- **Initial speed**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s
- **Obstacle location**: (100, 0)
- **Left lane Y-coordinate**: -5
- **Time interval**: 1-second increments

### Trajectory Plan:
1. Start in the right lane (Y = 0).
2. Gradually move into the left lane (Y = -5) while maintaining speed.
3. Pass the obstacle at X = 100 while staying in the left lane.
4. Return to the right lane after passing the obstacle.

### Trajectory Details:

#### **T = 0**
- Position: (0, 0)
- Speed: 20 m/s

#### **T = 1**
- Move slightly toward the left lane.
- Position: (20, -1)
- Speed: 20 m/s

#### **T = 2**
- Continue moving left.
- Position: (40, -2)
- Speed: 20 m/s

#### **T = 3**
- Almost fully in the left lane.
- Position: (60, -4)
- Speed: 20 m/s

#### **T = 4**
- Fully in the left lane.
- Position: (80, -5)
- Speed: 20 m/s

#### **T = 5**
- Passing the obstacle (X = 100).
- Position: (100, -5)
- Speed: 20 m/s

#### **T = 6**
- Continuing past the obstacle in the left lane.
- Position: (120, -5)
- Speed: 20 m/s

#### **T = 7**
- Begin moving back to the right lane.
- Position: (140, -4)
- Speed: 20 m/s

#### **T = 8**
- Moving further right.
- Position: (160, -2)
- Speed: 20 m/s

#### **T = 9**
- Almost fully in the right lane.
- Position: (180, -1)
- Speed: 20 m/s

#### **T = 10**
- Back in the right lane.
- Position: (200, 0)
- Speed: 20 m/s

### Summary:
The vehicle successfully completes the double lane change maneuver by:
1. Gradually moving into the left lane before reaching the obstacle.
2. Passing the obstacle at X = 100 while staying in the left lane.
3. Returning to the right lane after safely overtaking the obstacle.

This trajectory ensures safety, compliance with highway speed limits, and smooth lateral movements.
