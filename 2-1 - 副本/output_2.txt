To safely navigate the double lane change maneuver, we need to ensure the vehicle smoothly transitions into the left lane, passes the obstacle at $ X = 100 $, and then transitions back to the right lane. The trajectory must respect the highway's speed limits (over 60 km/h) and ensure a smooth lateral movement.

### Key Details:
- **Initial Speed**: $ 72 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} $
- **Obstacle Location**: $ (X, Y) = (100, 0) $
- **Left Lane Position**: $ Y = -5 $
- **Right Lane Position**: $ Y = 0 $

We'll assume the vehicle follows a smooth sinusoidal-like path for lateral movement to minimize discomfort and ensure safety.

### Trajectory Plan:
1. Start in the right lane ($ Y = 0 $).
2. Gradually move to the left lane ($ Y = -5 $) before reaching $ X = 100 $.
3. Stay in the left lane while passing the obstacle at $ X = 100 $.
4. Gradually return to the right lane after passing the obstacle.

The longitudinal position ($ X $) will increase linearly with time due to the constant speed of $ 20 \, \text{m/s} $. The lateral position ($ Y $) will follow a smooth transition function.

### Lateral Transition Function:
For simplicity, we use a sinusoidal function to model the lateral movement:
$$
Y(t) = A \cdot \sin\left(\frac{\pi t}{T_{\text{lateral}}} \right)
$$
Where:
- $ A $ is the amplitude of the lateral movement ($ A = -5 $ for moving to the left lane).
- $ T_{\text{lateral}} $ is the duration of the lateral transition (e.g., 3 seconds for each lane change).

#### Lane Change Parameters:
- First lane change: $ T_{\text{lateral}} = 3 \, \text{s} $ (from $ Y = 0 $ to $ Y = -5 $).
- Second lane change: $ T_{\text{lateral}} = 3 \, \text{s} $ (from $ Y = -5 $ back to $ Y = 0 $).

### Longitudinal Position:
The longitudinal position increases linearly with time:
$$
X(t) = 20t
$$

| 10       | 200            | 0             | Staying in the right lane              |

### Explanation:
1. From $ T = 0 $ to $ T = 3 $: The vehicle smoothly transitions from the right lane ($ Y = 0 $) to the left lane ($ Y = -5 $).
2. From $ T = 3 $ to $ T = 5 $: The vehicle remains in the left lane ($ Y = -5 $) while passing the obstacle at $ X = 100 $.
3. From $ T = 6 $ to $ T = 9 $: The vehicle smoothly transitions back to the right lane ($ Y = 0 $).
4. After $ T = 9 $: The vehicle continues driving in the right lane.

This trajectory ensures safe navigation around the obstacle while maintaining highway speed requirements.
