To safely navigate the double lane change maneuver while adhering to highway speed regulations, we need to plan a trajectory that ensures the vehicle smoothly transitions into the left lane before passing the obstacle at $ X = 100 $, and then transitions back to the right lane afterward. The vehicle must maintain a velocity of at least 60 km/h (approximately 16.67 m/s) throughout the maneuver.

### Key Details:
- Initial position: $ (X, Y) = (0, 0) $
- Obstacle position: $ (X, Y) = (100, 0) $
- Left lane: $ Y = -5 $
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s
- Minimum highway speed: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s

We will assume a smooth transition for lateral movement ($ Y $) using a sinusoidal-like function to ensure a gradual lane change. For longitudinal movement ($ X $), we'll maintain a near-constant velocity close to 20 m/s.

### Trajectory Calculation:

#### Step 1: Lane Change Timing
The total distance required for the maneuver is approximately $ X = 150 $ meters (from starting the lane change to returning to the right lane). At an average longitudinal velocity of 20 m/s, this will take about $ T = 7.5 $ seconds. To simplify, we'll calculate positions every second up to $ T = 10 $ seconds.

#### Step 2: Lateral Movement ($ Y $)
The lateral movement will follow a smooth curve described by:
$$
Y(T) = A \cdot \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{T_{\text{total}}} \cdot T\right),
$$
where:
- $ A = -5 $ (amplitude for the lane width),
- $ T_{\text{total}} = 7.5 $ seconds (time for the full maneuver).

For simplicity, we'll approximate the lateral movement as piecewise linear:
- Move from $ Y = 0 $ to $ Y = -5 $ over the first 3 seconds.
- Stay in the left lane ($ Y = -5 $) while passing the obstacle.
- Return to $ Y = 0 $ over the next 4 seconds.

#### Step 3: Longitudinal Movement ($ X $)
The longitudinal movement will be governed by:
$$
X(T) = V_{\text{avg}} \cdot T,
$$
where $ V_{\text{avg}} = 20 $ m/s initially, adjusted slightly if necessary to ensure safety.

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Lane Change (T = 0每3):**
   - Gradually move from $ Y = 0 $ to $ Y = -5 $ while traveling longitudinally.
   - At $ T = 3 $, the vehicle is fully in the left lane.

2. **Passing the Obstacle (T = 4每5):**
   - Maintain $ Y = -5 $ while passing the obstacle at $ X = 100 $.

3. **Returning to Right Lane (T = 6每8):**
   - Gradually move from $ Y = -5 $ back to $ Y = 0 $ while continuing forward.

4. **Final Straight Path (T = 9每10):**
   - Resume normal driving in the right lane.
