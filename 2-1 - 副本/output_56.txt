To safely execute the double lane change maneuver while maintaining a speed of over 60 km/h, we will carefully plan the trajectory. Below is the step-by-step breakdown of the vehicle's position in the next 10 seconds, with the assumption that the initial speed is **72 km/h** (or **20 m/s**) and the vehicle smoothly transitions laterally to avoid the obstacle.

---

### **Key Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle starts at position **(0, 0)**.
2. The obstacle is located at **(100, 0)**.
3. The left lane corresponds to **Y = -5**.
4. The vehicle must complete the lane change before reaching **X = 100**, stay in the left lane while passing the obstacle, and return to the right lane afterward.
5. The vehicle maintains a speed greater than **60 km/h** (or **16.67 m/s**).

### **Trajectory Plan:**

#### **Step 1: Lane Change to the Left Lane**
- Start transitioning from **Y = 0** to **Y = -5** over the first few seconds.
- Maintain forward speed at **20 m/s**.

#### **Step 2: Pass the Obstacle**
- Stay in the left lane (**Y = -5**) as the vehicle passes the obstacle at **X = 100**.

#### **Step 3: Lane Change Back to the Right Lane**
- Transition back from **Y = -5** to **Y = 0** after passing the obstacle.

### **Explanation of the Trajectory:**
1. **Initial Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 4):**
   - The vehicle smoothly transitions from **Y = 0** to **Y = -5** while maintaining a forward speed of **20 m/s**.
   - By **T = 4**, the vehicle is fully in the left lane.

2. **Passing the Obstacle (T = 5):**
   - At **T = 5**, the vehicle reaches **X = 100** and is fully in the left lane (**Y = -5**), safely passing the obstacle.

3. **Return to the Right Lane (T = 6 to T = 10):**
   - After passing the obstacle, the vehicle begins transitioning back to the right lane.
   - By **T = 10**, the vehicle is fully back in the right lane (**Y = 0**) at **X = 200**.

### **Final Answer:**
The positions of the vehicle at each second are as follows:

- **T = 1:** (20, -1)
- **T = 2:** (40, -2)
- **T = 3:** (60, -3)
- **T = 4:** (80, -4)
- **T = 5:** (100, -5)
- **T = 6:** (120, -5)
- **T = 7:** (140, -4)
- **T = 8:** (160, -3)
- **T = 9:** (180, -2)
- **T = 10:** (200, 0)

This trajectory ensures safe passage of the obstacle while adhering to highway speed requirements.
