To safely perform the double-lane change maneuver while maintaining highway speeds and ensuring safe clearance from the obstacle, we need to plan a smooth trajectory that transitions the vehicle into the left lane before reaching the obstacle at X = 100, passes it, and then switches back to the right lane afterward. Below is the planned trajectory for the next 10 seconds.

### Assumptions:
1. The initial velocity of the vehicle is **72 km/h**, which converts to **20 m/s**.
2. Highway speed must remain above **60 km/h (16.67 m/s)**.
3. The vehicle will smoothly transition its lateral position (Y-axis) using gradual steering inputs.
4. The longitudinal distance (X-axis) will increase linearly with time based on the vehicle's speed.

### Trajectory Plan

#### Initial Conditions:
- At **T = 0**: Position = (0, 0), Velocity = 20 m/s.

#### Step-by-Step Path:

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y)       | Notes                                                                 |
|----------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **T = 1** | (20, -0.5)            | Begin gentle steering input to move toward the left lane.             |
| **T = 2** | (40, -1.5)            | Continue moving leftward while maintaining forward speed.               |
| **T = 3** | (60, -3.0)            | Progressively approach the left lane.                                  |
| **T = 4** | (80, -4.5)            | Near the left lane; prepare to fully occupy it as X approaches 100.    |
| **T = 5** | (100, -5.0)           | Fully in the left lane, passing the stopped vehicle safely.            |
| **T = 6** | (120, -5.0)           | Remain in the left lane while continuing to drive forward.             |
| **T = 7** | (140, -4.5)           | Begin transitioning back to the right lane after clearing the obstacle. |
| **T = 8** | (160, -3.0)           | Gradually steer toward the right lane.                                |
| **T = 9** | (180, -1.5)           | Almost aligned with the right lane.                                   |
| **T = 10**| (200, 0.0)            | Successfully return to the right lane.                                 |

### Explanation of the Maneuver:
1. **Lateral Movement (Y-Axis):**
   - From **T = 1** to **T = 4**, the vehicle gradually moves from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -5).
   - At **T = 5**, the vehicle is fully in the left lane and clears the obstacle at X = 100.
   - From **T = 7** to **T = 10**, the vehicle transitions back to the right lane.

2. **Longitudinal Movement (X-Axis):**
   - The vehicle maintains a constant speed of approximately **20 m/s (72 km/h)** throughout the maneuver.
   - This ensures compliance with highway speed limits and provides sufficient distance to execute the lane changes safely.

3. **Safety Considerations:**
   - Smooth transitions in the Y-axis prevent abrupt maneuvers that could destabilize the vehicle or surprise other drivers.
   - Adequate clearance from the obstacle is ensured by staying in the left lane (Y = -5) while passing it.

By following this trajectory, the vehicle successfully avoids the obstacle while adhering to highway driving norms.
