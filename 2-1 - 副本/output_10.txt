To safely navigate the double lane change maneuver while maintaining highway speed, we need to plan a smooth trajectory that avoids the obstacle at (100, 0) and ensures compliance with highway speed regulations. The vehicle starts at (0, 0), and the left lane is represented by Y = -5. Below is the planned trajectory for the next 10 seconds:

### Key Assumptions:
1. Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
2. Highway minimum speed: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.
3. Vehicle maintains a constant longitudinal speed of 20 m/s during the maneuver.
4. Lateral movement is gradual and controlled to ensure safety.

### Planned Trajectory:

| **Time (T)** | **Position (X, Y)** | **Description**                  |
|--------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| T = 0        | (0, 0)              | Start in the right lane.         |
| T = 1        | (20, -0.5)          | Begin gradual move to the left.  |
| T = 2        | (40, -1.5)          | Continue moving left.            |
| T = 3        | (60, -3.0)          | Progressively shift to the left. |
| T = 4        | (80, -4.5)          | Almost fully in the left lane.   |
| T = 5        | (100, -5.0)         | Fully in the left lane, passing the obstacle. |
| T = 6        | (120, -5.0)         | Remain in the left lane.         |
| T = 7        | (140, -4.5)          | Begin gradual move back to the right lane. |
| T = 8        | (160, -3.0)         | Continue moving right.           |
| T = 9        | (180, -1.5)         | Progressively shift to the right.|
| T = 10       | (200, 0)            | Fully back in the right lane.    |

### Explanation of the Maneuver:
1. **Initial Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 5):**
   - The vehicle moves gradually from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -5).
   - By T = 5, the vehicle is fully in the left lane at X = 100, successfully avoiding the obstacle.

2. **Passing the Obstacle (T = 5 to T = 6):**
   - The vehicle remains in the left lane as it passes the obstacle at X = 100.

3. **Returning to the Right Lane (T = 6 to T = 10):**
   - After clearing the obstacle, the vehicle begins a gradual return to the right lane.
   - By T = 10, the vehicle is fully back in the right lane at X = 200.

### Notes:
- The lateral movement (Y-axis) is smooth and controlled to ensure passenger comfort and safety.
- The longitudinal speed (X-axis) remains constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h), ensuring compliance with highway speed regulations.
- This trajectory assumes no other vehicles are present in the left lane during the maneuver. If there are, adjustments would be necessary.
