To safely navigate around the obstacle and complete the double lane change maneuver, we need to plan a smooth trajectory that ensures the vehicle stays within the required speed range (over 60 km/h) and avoids the obstacle located at \( X = 100 \). Below is a detailed trajectory for the next 10 seconds:

### **Initial Conditions**
- Initial position: \( (X, Y) = (0, 0) \)
- Initial velocity: \( v = 72 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \)
- Obstacle location: \( (X, Y) = (100, 0) \)
- Left lane: \( Y = -5 \)

### **Trajectory Plan**
1. Start in the right lane (\( Y = 0 \)).
2. Gradually move into the left lane (\( Y = -5 \)) while maintaining a safe distance from the obstacle.
3. Pass the obstacle at \( X = 100 \) while staying in the left lane (\( Y = -5 \)).
4. Move back to the right lane (\( Y = 0 \)) after passing the obstacle.

We will calculate the position of the vehicle every second (\( T = 1, 2, 3, \ldots \)) until the maneuver is completed.

### **Step-by-Step Trajectory**

#### **T = 0**
- Position: \( (X, Y) = (0, 0) \)
- Velocity: \( v = 20 \, \text{m/s} \)

#### **T = 1**
- \( X = 20 \, \text{m} \) (traveling forward at 20 m/s)
- \( Y = -1 \, \text{m} \) (gradually moving toward the left lane)
- Position: \( (X, Y) = (20, -1) \)

#### **T = 2**
- \( X = 40 \, \text{m} \)
- \( Y = -2 \, \text{m} \)
- Position: \( (X, Y) = (40, -2) \)

#### **T = 3**
- \( X = 60 \, \text{m} \)
- \( Y = -3 \, \text{m} \)
- Position: \( (X, Y) = (60, -3) \)

#### **T = 4**
- \( X = 80 \, \text{m} \)
- \( Y = -4 \, \text{m} \)
- Position: \( (X, Y) = (80, -4) \)

#### **T = 5**
- \( X = 100 \, \text{m} \) (reaching the obstacle)
- \( Y = -5 \, \text{m} \) (fully in the left lane)
- Position: \( (X, Y) = (100, -5) \)

#### **T = 6**
- \( X = 120 \, \text{m} \)
- \( Y = -5 \, \text{m} \) (staying in the left lane)
- Position: \( (X, Y) = (120, -5) \)

#### **T = 7**
- \( X = 140 \, \text{m} \)
- \( Y = -4 \, \text{m} \) (gradually moving back to the right lane)
- Position: \( (X, Y) = (140, -4) \)

#### **T = 8**
- \( X = 160 \, \text{m} \)
- \( Y = -3 \, \text{m} \)
- Position: \( (X, Y) = (160, -3) \)

#### **T = 9**
- \( X = 180 \, \text{m} \)
- \( Y = -2 \, \text{m} \)
- Position: \( (X, Y) = (180, -2) \)

#### **T = 10**
- \( X = 200 \, \text{m} \)
- \( Y = -1 \, \text{m} \) (almost back in the right lane)
- Position: \( (X, Y) = (200, -1) \)

### **Completion of Maneuver**
After \( T = 10 \), the vehicle can fully return to the right lane (\( Y = 0 \)) while continuing to travel forward at a safe speed. The double lane change maneuver is now complete.

### **Final Answer**
The positions of the vehicle at each time step are as follows:
\[
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
& T = 0: (0, 0) \\
& T = 1: (20, -1) \\
& T = 2: (40, -2) \\
& T = 3: (60, -3) \\
& T = 4: (80, -4) \\
& T = 5: (100, -5) \\
& T = 6: (120, -5) \\
& T = 7: (140, -4) \\
& T = 8: (160, -3) \\
& T = 9: (180, -2) \\
& T = 10: (200, -1)
\end{aligned}
}
