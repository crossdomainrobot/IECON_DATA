To safely perform the double lane change maneuver while maintaining highway speeds, we need to carefully plan the trajectory of the vehicle. The goal is to smoothly transition into the left lane, pass the obstacle at X = 100, and then return to the right lane afterward. Here's how the trajectory will unfold:

### Key Assumptions:
1. **Initial Speed**: 72 km/h (20 m/s).
2. **Lane Width**: Y = -5 for the left lane, Y = 0 for the right lane.
3. **Highway Speed Requirement**: Maintain a speed of over 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).
4. **Obstacle Location**: (X = 100, Y = 0).

We'll calculate the positions at each second (T = 1, 2, ..., 10) and beyond until the maneuver is complete.

### Trajectory Plan:
The maneuver involves three phases:
1. **Lane Change to Left Lane**: Gradually move from Y = 0 to Y = -5 while continuing forward at a reduced speed.
2. **Pass Obstacle in Left Lane**: Maintain Y = -5 and accelerate back to highway speed.
3. **Return to Right Lane**: Gradually move from Y = -5 back to Y = 0 after passing the obstacle.

### Detailed Position Calculations:
#### Phase 1: Lane Change to Left Lane (T = 0 to T = 5)
- Reduce speed slightly during the lane change to ensure safety.
- Accelerate back to highway speed once in the left lane.

| Time (T) | X (m)   | Y (m)   | Notes                                      |
|----------|----------|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| 0        | 0        | 0        | Initial position                          |
| 1        | 20       | -1       | Begin moving toward left lane             |
| 2        | 40       | -2       | Continue lateral movement                 |
| 3        | 60       | -3       | Progressively shift to left lane          |
| 4        | 80       | -4       | Almost fully in the left lane            |
| 5        | 95       | -5       | Fully in the left lane                   |

At T = 5, the vehicle is fully in the left lane (Y = -5) and approaching the obstacle.

---

#### Phase 2: Pass Obstacle in Left Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)
- Maintain Y = -5 and accelerate back to highway speed (20 m/s).

| Time (T) | X (m)   | Y (m)   | Notes                                      |
|----------|----------|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| 6        | 115      | -5       | Passing the obstacle                      |
| 7        | 135      | -5       | Continuing past the obstacle              |
| 8        | 155      | -5       | Safely past the obstacle                 |

At T = 8, the vehicle has passed the obstacle and is ready to return to the right lane.

---

#### Phase 3: Return to Right Lane (T = 9 to T = 11)
- Gradually move back to the right lane while maintaining highway speed.

| Time (T) | X (m)   | Y (m)   | Notes                                      |
|----------|----------|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| 9        | 175      | -4       | Begin moving back to the right lane       |
| 10       | 195      | -2       | Continue lateral movement                 |
| 11       | 215      | 0        | Fully back in the right lane              |

At T = 11, the vehicle is fully back in the right lane (Y = 0) and continues driving at highway speed.

### Final Answer:
The trajectory for the next 11 seconds is as follows:

- **T = 0**: (0, 0)
- **T = 1**: (20, -1)
- **T = 2**: (40, -2)
- **T = 3**: (60, -3)
- **T = 4**: (80, -4)
- **T = 5**: (95, -5)
- **T = 6**: (115, -5)
- **T = 7**: (135, -5)
- **T = 8**: (155, -5)
- **T = 9**: (175, -4)
- **T = 10**: (195, -2)
- **T = 11**: (215, 0)

This trajectory ensures a safe and smooth double lane change maneuver while maintaining highway speeds.
