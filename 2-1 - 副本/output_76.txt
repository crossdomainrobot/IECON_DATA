To safely navigate around the obstacle vehicle located at (100, 0), we need to plan a smooth and safe trajectory that ensures the following:

1. **Initial Lane Change:** Gradually move from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -5).
2. **Passing the Obstacle:** Stay in the left lane while passing the obstacle at X = 100.
3. **Return to Right Lane:** Gradually return to the right lane (Y = 0) after passing the obstacle.

### Key Assumptions:
- Initial speed: 72 km/h ¡Ö 20 m/s.
- Minimum highway speed: > 60 km/h ¡Ö 16.67 m/s.
- Acceleration/deceleration for lateral movement is gradual and safe.
- The longitudinal position (X) increases steadily at approximately 20 m/s.

Here¡¯s the planned trajectory:

### Trajectory Plan

#### **T = 0**
- Position: (0, 0)
- Speed: 20 m/s
- Lane: Right lane

---

#### **T = 1**
- Position: (20, -0.5)
- Speed: 20 m/s
- Lane: Starting to move slightly left

---

#### **T = 2**
- Position: (40, -1.5)
- Speed: 20 m/s
- Lane: Continuing to move left

---

#### **T = 3**
- Position: (60, -3)
- Speed: 20 m/s
- Lane: Nearing the left lane

---

#### **T = 4**
- Position: (80, -4.5)
- Speed: 20 m/s
- Lane: Almost fully in the left lane

---

#### **T = 5**
- Position: (100, -5)
- Speed: 20 m/s
- Lane: Fully in the left lane (passing the obstacle)

---

#### **T = 6**
- Position: (120, -5)
- Speed: 20 m/s
- Lane: Maintaining position in the left lane

---

#### **T = 7**
- Position: (140, -4.5)
- Speed: 20 m/s
- Lane: Starting to move back to the right lane

---

#### **T = 8**
- Position: (160, -3)
- Speed: 20 m/s
- Lane: Continuing to move right

---

#### **T = 9**
- Position: (180, -1.5)
- Speed: 20 m/s
- Lane: Nearly back in the right lane

---

#### **T = 10**
- Position: (200, 0)
- Speed: 20 m/s
- Lane: Fully back in the right lane

### Summary of Key Points:
1. **Lane Change Timing:**
   - Start moving left at T = 1.
   - Fully in the left lane by T = 5 (at X = 100).
   - Begin returning to the right lane at T = 7.
   - Fully back in the right lane by T = 10.

2. **Speed Management:**
   - Maintain a constant speed of 20 m/s throughout the maneuver to comply with highway speed regulations.

This trajectory ensures a smooth and safe double lane change while adhering to highway driving rules.
