To safely perform the double lane change maneuver while adhering to highway speed regulations, I will plan a smooth trajectory that ensures safe clearance of the obstacle and compliance with speed limits. Below is the step-by-step plan for the vehicle's position over time:

### **Initial Conditions**
- Initial position: (0, 0)
- Obstacle position: (100, 0)
- Left lane Y-coordinate: -5
- Initial speed: 72 km/h = 20 m/s
- Minimum highway speed: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s

The goal is to:
1. Gradually move into the left lane.
2. Pass the obstacle at X = 100 in the left lane.
3. Return to the right lane after passing the obstacle.

### **Trajectory Plan**

#### **Step 1: Lane Change Preparation (T = 0 to T = 4)**
- Gradually steer the vehicle from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -5).
- Maintain a constant longitudinal speed of 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| T = 0    | (0, 0)          |
| T = 1    | (20, -1.25)     |
| T = 2    | (40, -2.5)      |
| T = 3    | (60, -3.75)     |
| T = 4    | (80, -5)        |

At T = 4, the vehicle has fully transitioned into the left lane.

---

#### **Step 2: Passing the Obstacle (T = 4 to T = 6)**
- Continue driving in the left lane at a constant speed of 20 m/s.
- Ensure the vehicle remains in the left lane (Y = -5) as it passes the obstacle at X = 100.

| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| T = 4    | (80, -5)        |
| T = 5    | (100, -5)       |
| T = 6    | (120, -5)       |

At T = 5, the vehicle successfully passes the obstacle at X = 100.

---

#### **Step 3: Returning to the Right Lane (T = 6 to T = 10)**
- Gradually steer the vehicle back to the right lane (Y = 0).
- Maintain a constant longitudinal speed of 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| T = 6    | (120, -5)       |
| T = 7    | (140, -3.75)    |
| T = 8    | (160, -2.5)     |
| T = 9    | (180, -1.25)    |
| T = 10   | (200, 0)        |

At T = 10, the vehicle has fully returned to the right lane.

---

### **Summary of Trajectory**
The vehicle smoothly transitions into the left lane, passes the obstacle, and returns to the right lane while maintaining a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h). The lateral movement (Y-axis) is gradual to ensure stability and safety during the maneuver.
