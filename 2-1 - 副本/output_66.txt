To safely execute the double lane change maneuver while maintaining highway speed constraints, we will carefully plan the trajectory of the vehicle. The goal is to smoothly transition into the left lane, pass the obstacle at $ X = 100 $, and then return to the right lane after clearing the obstacle. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the trajectory:

### Key Assumptions:
1. **Initial Speed**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
2. **Highway Speed Constraint**: Maintain a speed greater than 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).
3. **Lane Width**: Assume lanes are 5 meters wide ($ Y = -5 $ for the left lane, $ Y = 0 $ for the right lane).
4. **Obstacle Position**: At $ (X, Y) = (100, 0) $.

### Trajectory Planning:
We'll divide the maneuver into three phases:
1. **Lane Change to Left Lane**: Gradually move from $ Y = 0 $ to $ Y = -5 $ while continuing forward.
2. **Pass Obstacle in Left Lane**: Stay in the left lane ($ Y = -5 $) as you pass $ X = 100 $.
3. **Lane Change Back to Right Lane**: Gradually move back from $ Y = -5 $ to $ Y = 0 $ after passing the obstacle.

The vehicle's position will be provided at each second ($ T = 1, 2, \dots $).

### Phase 1: Lane Change to Left Lane
- Start at $ (X, Y) = (0, 0) $.
- Begin a smooth lateral movement to $ Y = -5 $ while maintaining forward speed close to 20 m/s.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y)   | Explanation                              |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)           | Initial position.                       |
| 1        | (20, -1)         | Move forward 20 m, start lateral shift. |
| 2        | (40, -2)         | Continue forward and lateral shift.     |
| 3        | (60, -3)         | Progressively shift left.               |
| 4        | (80, -4)         | Almost fully in the left lane.          |
| 5        | (100, -5)        | Fully in the left lane, aligned with obstacle. |

At $ T = 5 $, the vehicle is now in the left lane and ready to pass the obstacle.

### Phase 2: Pass Obstacle in Left Lane
- Continue driving straight in the left lane ($ Y = -5 $) while passing the obstacle at $ X = 100 $.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y)   | Explanation                              |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 6        | (120, -5)         | Pass the obstacle.                       |
| 7        | (140, -5)         | Continue forward in the left lane.      |
| 8        | (160, -5)         | Maintain position in the left lane.     |

By $ T = 8 $, the vehicle has safely passed the obstacle and is ready to return to the right lane.

---

### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to Right Lane
- Gradually move back from $ Y = -5 $ to $ Y = 0 $ while continuing forward.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y)   | Explanation                              |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 9        | (180, -4)         | Begin shifting back to the right lane.   |
| 10       | (200, -3)         | Continue lateral movement.               |
| 11       | (220, -2)         | Progressively shift right.               |
| 12       | (240, -1)         | Almost fully in the right lane.          |
| 13       | (260, 0)          | Fully back in the right lane.            |

### Final Trajectory Summary:
Here¡¯s the complete trajectory over time:

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y)   |
|----------|-------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)           |
| 1        | (20, -1)         |
| 2        | (40, -2)         |
| 3        | (60, -3)         |
| 4        | (80, -4)         |
| 5        | (100, -5)        |
| 6        | (120, -5)        |
| 7        | (140, -5)        |
| 8        | (160, -5)        |
| 9        | (180, -4)        |
| 10       | (200, -3)        |
| 11       | (220, -2)        |
| 12       | (240, -1)        |
| 13       | (260, 0)         |

This trajectory ensures that the vehicle:
1. Safely transitions to the left lane.
2. Passes the obstacle without deviating from the highway speed constraint.
3. Returns to the right lane after clearing the obstacle.
