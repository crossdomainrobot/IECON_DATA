To safely navigate the double lane change maneuver while maintaining highway speed, we will carefully plan a trajectory that ensures smooth transitions between lanes and adherence to the speed requirements. Below is the detailed trajectory for the vehicle's position over time:

### Key Details:
- **Initial Position:** (0, 0) at T = 0
- **Obstacle Location:** (100, 0)
- **Left Lane Y-coordinate:** -5
- **Initial Speed:** 72 km/h ¡Ö 20 m/s
- **Minimum Highway Speed:** 60 km/h ¡Ö 16.67 m/s

We will assume a constant longitudinal speed of approximately **18 m/s** (slightly reduced from 20 m/s to allow for safe maneuvering). The lateral movement (Y-direction) will involve gradual transitions to avoid abrupt changes.

### Trajectory Plan:
#### Phase 1: Begin Lane Change to Left Lane (T = 0 to T = 3)
The vehicle starts moving laterally toward the left lane while maintaining a steady longitudinal speed.

| Time (T) | X (m)   | Y (m) |
|----------|----------|-------|
| 0        | 0        | 0     |
| 1        | 18       | -1    |
| 2        | 36       | -2    |
| 3        | 54       | -4    |

At T = 3, the vehicle is nearly in the left lane (Y ¡Ö -5).

---

#### Phase 2: Traverse Left Lane Past Obstacle (T = 3 to T = 7)
The vehicle continues straight in the left lane, maintaining a constant speed of 18 m/s to pass the obstacle safely.

| Time (T) | X (m)   | Y (m) |
|----------|----------|-------|
| 4        | 72       | -5    |
| 5        | 90       | -5    |
| 6        | 108      | -5    |
| 7        | 126      | -5    |

By T = 6, the vehicle has passed the obstacle (X = 100).

---

#### Phase 3: Return to Right Lane (T = 7 to T = 10)
The vehicle begins transitioning back to the right lane while continuing forward at 18 m/s.

| Time (T) | X (m)   | Y (m) |
|----------|----------|-------|
| 8        | 144      | -3    |
| 9        | 162      | -1    |
| 10       | 180      | 0     |

At T = 10, the vehicle has returned to the right lane (Y = 0).

---

### Final Summary:
The vehicle successfully completes the double lane change maneuver by:
1. Moving to the left lane before reaching the obstacle.
2. Passing the obstacle in the left lane.
3. Returning to the right lane after clearing the obstacle.

Here¡¯s the complete trajectory:

| Time (T) | X (m)   | Y (m) |
|----------|----------|-------|
| 0        | 0        | 0     |
| 1        | 18       | -1    |
| 2        | 36       | -2    |
| 3        | 54       | -4    |
| 4        | 72       | -5    |
| 5        | 90       | -5    |
| 6        | 108      | -5    |
| 7        | 126      | -5    |
| 8        | 144      | -3    |
| 9        | 162      | -1    |
| 10       | 180      | 0     |

This trajectory ensures safety, compliance with highway speed limits, and smooth lane changes.
