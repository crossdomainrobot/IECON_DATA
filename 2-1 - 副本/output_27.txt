To safely navigate the obstacle and complete the double lane change maneuver, I will plan a trajectory that involves gradually moving into the left lane, passing the stopped vehicle at X = 100, and then returning to the right lane afterward. Below is the step-by-step trajectory for the next 10 seconds:

### Key Assumptions:
- **Initial speed:** 72 km/h = 20 m/s
- **Minimum highway speed:** 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s
- **Lateral movement (Y-axis):** Smooth transition between lanes to ensure safety.
- **Longitudinal movement (X-axis):** Maintain a constant speed of approximately 20 m/s while transitioning.

### Trajectory Plan:
We will divide the maneuver into three phases:
1. **Transition to the left lane (T = 0 to T = 5).**
2. **Pass the obstacle in the left lane (T = 5 to T = 8).**
3. **Return to the right lane after passing the obstacle (T = 8 onward).**

---

### Position at Each Timepoint:
#### Phase 1: Transition to the Left Lane (T = 0 to T = 5)
During this phase, the vehicle moves from Y = 0 (right lane) to Y = -5 (left lane) while continuing forward at ~20 m/s.

| **Time (T)** | **Position (X, Y)** |
|--------------|----------------------|
| T = 0        | (0, 0)              |
| T = 1        | (20, -1)            |
| T = 2        | (40, -2)            |
| T = 3        | (60, -3)            |
| T = 4        | (80, -4)            |
| T = 5        | (100, -5)           |

At T = 5, the vehicle has fully transitioned into the left lane and is aligned with the obstacle at X = 100.

---

#### Phase 2: Pass the Obstacle in the Left Lane (T = 5 to T = 8)
In this phase, the vehicle remains in the left lane (Y = -5) and continues forward at ~20 m/s to overtake the obstacle.

| **Time (T)** | **Position (X, Y)** |
|--------------|----------------------|
| T = 5        | (100, -5)           |
| T = 6        | (120, -5)           |
| T = 7        | (140, -5)           |
| T = 8        | (160, -5)           |

By T = 8, the vehicle has safely passed the obstacle and is well ahead of it in the left lane.

---

#### Phase 3: Return to the Right Lane (T = 8 onward)
Finally, the vehicle transitions back to the right lane (Y = 0) while maintaining its forward speed.

| **Time (T)** | **Position (X, Y)** |
|--------------|----------------------|
| T = 8        | (160, -5)           |
| T = 9        | (180, -3)           |
| T = 10       | (200, 0)            |

At T = 10, the vehicle has successfully returned to the right lane and resumed normal driving.

---

### Summary of Maneuver:
- The vehicle transitions smoothly into the left lane over 5 seconds.
- It passes the obstacle at X = 100 while remaining in the left lane.
- After overtaking the obstacle, it transitions back to the right lane over 2 seconds.
- Throughout the maneuver, the vehicle maintains a speed of at least 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).

This trajectory ensures safe navigation around the obstacle while adhering to highway driving regulations.
