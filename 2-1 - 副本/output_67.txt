To ensure the vehicle passes the obstacle safely while maintaining highway speed, we will execute a smooth double lane change maneuver. Below is a detailed trajectory plan for the next 10 seconds, with positions provided at each second (T = 1, 2, ..., 10). The vehicle's initial speed is 72 km/h (or 20 m/s), and it must stay above 60 km/h (or 16.67 m/s) during the maneuver.

### **Trajectory Plan**
#### Initial Conditions:
- Initial position: (0, 0)
- Initial velocity: 20 m/s along X-axis
- Obstacle location: (100, 0)

#### Maneuver Steps:
1. Gradually move into the left lane (Y = -5) while maintaining speed.
2. Stay in the left lane as the vehicle passes the obstacle at X = 100.
3. Return to the right lane after safely passing the obstacle.

| 0        | (0, 0)           | Starting position in the right lane.                                   |
| 1        | (20, -1)         | Begin lateral movement toward the left lane.                          |
| 2        | (40, -2)         | Continue moving leftward while maintaining longitudinal speed.          |
| 3        | (60, -3)         | Progressively shift into the left lane.                               |
| 4        | (80, -4)         | Nearly fully in the left lane.                                        |
| 5        | (100, -5)        | Fully in the left lane, passing the obstacle at X = 100.              |
| 6        | (120, -5)        | Remain in the left lane, continuing past the obstacle.                 |
| 7        | (140, -4)        | Begin shifting back to the right lane.                                |
| 8        | (160, -3)        | Continue moving rightward while maintaining speed.                     |
| 9        | (180, -2)        | Almost fully returned to the right lane.                              |
| 10       | (200, 0)         | Back in the right lane, completing the maneuver.                       |

### **Explanation of the Trajectory**
1. **Lateral Movement**: 
   - From T = 1 to T = 4, the vehicle gradually shifts from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -5).
   - This ensures a smooth transition without abrupt changes in direction.

2. **Passing the Obstacle**:
   - At T = 5, the vehicle is fully in the left lane (Y = -5) and aligned with the obstacle at X = 100.
   - The vehicle continues moving forward in the left lane for one additional second (T = 6) to ensure safe clearance.

3. **Returning to the Right Lane**:
   - From T = 7 to T = 10, the vehicle gradually shifts back to the right lane (Y = 0).
   - By T = 10, the maneuver is complete, and the vehicle resumes normal driving in the right lane.

### **Speed Considerations**
- The vehicle maintains a longitudinal speed of at least 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
- This ensures compliance with highway speed requirements and minimizes disruption to surrounding traffic.

This trajectory ensures safety, smoothness, and adherence to highway driving norms. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
