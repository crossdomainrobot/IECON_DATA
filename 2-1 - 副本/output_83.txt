To safely execute the double lane change maneuver while adhering to highway speed regulations, we need to plan a smooth trajectory that ensures safe overtaking of the obstacle vehicle. The key is to smoothly transition into the left lane, overtake the obstacle, and then return to the right lane after passing it.

### **Initial Conditions:**
- Initial position: (0, 0)
- Obstacle position: (100, 0)
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s
- Left lane Y-coordinate: -5
- Highway minimum speed: > 60 km/h = > 16.67 m/s

We will assume:
1. A constant longitudinal speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) to maintain highway speed.
2. Smooth lateral transitions between lanes using a sinusoidal or polynomial curve for comfort and safety.

### **Trajectory Plan:**

#### **Step 1: Transition to the Left Lane (T = 0 to T = 5 seconds)**
- Start moving laterally from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -5).
- Use a sinusoidal or polynomial function for smooth lateral movement.

**Equation for Y (lateral position):**
$$
Y(t) = -5 \cdot \left(1 - \cos\left(\frac{\pi t}{5}\right)\right), \quad 0 \leq t \leq 5
$$

**X (longitudinal position):**
$$
X(t) = 20t
$$

| Time (T) | X Position (m) | Y Position (m) |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| 0        | 0              | 0             |
| 1        | 20             | -1.23         |
| 2        | 40             | -3.07         |
| 3        | 60             | -4.54         |
| 4        | 80             | -4.96         |
| 5        | 100            | -5            |

At T = 5 seconds, the vehicle reaches the left lane (Y = -5) just as it approaches the obstacle at X = 100.

---

#### **Step 2: Maintain Left Lane Position (T = 5 to T = 10 seconds)**
- Continue driving in the left lane (Y = -5) to overtake the obstacle.
- Maintain a constant longitudinal speed of 20 m/s.

**X (longitudinal position):**
$$
X(t) = 20t
$$

**Y (lateral position):**
$$
Y(t) = -5, \quad 5 \leq t \leq 10
$$

| Time (T) | X Position (m) | Y Position (m) |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| 5        | 100            | -5            |
| 6        | 120            | -5            |
| 7        | 140            | -5            |
| 8        | 160            | -5            |
| 9        | 180            | -5            |
| 10       | 200            | -5            |

By T = 10 seconds, the vehicle has safely overtaken the obstacle.

---

#### **Step 3: Transition Back to the Right Lane (T = 10 to T = 15 seconds)**
- Begin transitioning back to the right lane (Y = 0) while maintaining highway speed.
- Use a similar sinusoidal or polynomial function for smooth lateral movement.

**Equation for Y (lateral position):**
$$
Y(t) = -5 + 5 \cdot \cos\left(\frac{\pi (t - 10)}{5}\right), \quad 10 \leq t \leq 15
$$

**X (longitudinal position):**
$$
X(t) = 20t
$$

| Time (T) | X Position (m) | Y Position (m) |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| 10       | 200            | -5            |
| 11       | 220            | -3.07         |
| 12       | 240            | -1.23         |
| 13       | 260            | 0             |
| 14       | 280            | 1.23          |
| 15       | 300            | 0             |

At T = 15 seconds, the vehicle successfully returns to the right lane (Y = 0).

### **Final Trajectory Summary:**
The vehicle follows this path:
1. Moves laterally to the left lane (T = 0 to T = 5).
2. Maintains the left lane to overtake the obstacle (T = 5 to T = 10).
3. Returns to the right lane after passing the obstacle (T = 10 to T = 15).

This trajectory ensures safety, smoothness, and adherence to highway speed regulations.

**Boxed Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{
\text{The vehicle transitions to the left lane by T = 5, maintains it until T = 10, and returns to the right lane by T = 15.}
}
