To safely navigate the obstacle, I'll describe a trajectory that smoothly transitions to the left lane before reaching the obstacle at X = 100 and returns to the right lane afterward. The vehicle will maintain a speed of approximately 72 km/h (20 m/s) during this maneuver.

### Initial Setup:
- **Initial position**: (0, 0)
- **Obstacle position**: (100, 0)
- **Left lane Y-coordinate**: -5
- **Right lane Y-coordinate**: 0
- **Speed**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s

We'll use a smooth lateral transition (Y-coordinate change) while maintaining forward progress along the X-axis.

### Trajectory Plan:

#### **T = 0**
- Position: (0, 0)

#### **T = 1**
- Forward movement: $ X = 20 \times 1 = 20 $
- Start transitioning laterally: $ Y = -1 $ (gradual move toward the left lane)
- Position: (20, -1)

#### **T = 2**
- Forward movement: $ X = 20 \times 2 = 40 $
- Continue lateral transition: $ Y = -2 $
- Position: (40, -2)

#### **T = 3**
- Forward movement: $ X = 20 \times 3 = 60 $
- Continue lateral transition: $ Y = -3 $
- Position: (60, -3)

#### **T = 4**
- Forward movement: $ X = 20 \times 4 = 80 $
- Fully transitioned to the left lane: $ Y = -5 $
- Position: (80, -5)

#### **T = 5**
- Forward movement: $ X = 20 \times 5 = 100 $
- Remain in the left lane to pass the obstacle: $ Y = -5 $
- Position: (100, -5)

#### **T = 6**
- Forward movement: $ X = 20 \times 6 = 120 $
- Begin transitioning back to the right lane: $ Y = -4 $
- Position: (120, -4)

#### **T = 7**
- Forward movement: $ X = 20 \times 7 = 140 $
- Continue lateral transition: $ Y = -3 $
- Position: (140, -3)

#### **T = 8**
- Forward movement: $ X = 20 \times 8 = 160 $
- Continue lateral transition: $ Y = -2 $
- Position: (160, -2)

#### **T = 9**
- Forward movement: $ X = 20 \times 9 = 180 $
- Continue lateral transition: $ Y = -1 $
- Position: (180, -1)

#### **T = 10**
- Forward movement: $ X = 20 \times 10 = 200 $
- Fully transitioned back to the right lane: $ Y = 0 $
- Position: (200, 0)

### Summary of Path:
The vehicle smoothly transitions to the left lane, passes the obstacle at X = 100, and then transitions back to the right lane. Here are the positions at each second:

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -1)        |
| 2        | (40, -2)        |
| 3        | (60, -3)        |
| 4        | (80, -5)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -4)       |
| 7        | (140, -3)       |
| 8        | (160, -2)       |
| 9        | (180, -1)       |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

This trajectory ensures safe passage around the obstacle while adhering to highway driving rules.
