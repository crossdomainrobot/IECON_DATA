To safely navigate the double lane change maneuver while maintaining highway speed, I will plan a smooth trajectory that ensures the vehicle remains at or above 60 km/h and avoids the obstacle located at (100, 0). Below is the detailed trajectory for the next 10 seconds:

### **Initial Conditions:**
- Initial position: (0, 0)
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s
- Obstacle position: (100, 0)
- Left lane Y-coordinate: -5

---

### **Trajectory Plan:**
The vehicle will:
1. Gradually move into the left lane starting from T = 0.
2. Pass the obstacle at X = 100 in the left lane (Y = -5).
3. Gradually return to the right lane after passing the obstacle.

Here¡¯s the step-by-step trajectory:

#### **T = 0 (Initial Position):**
- Position: (0, 0)

#### **T = 1:**
- The vehicle begins to shift slightly to the left.
- Position: (20, -1)

#### **T = 2:**
- The vehicle continues shifting left while maintaining speed.
- Position: (40, -2)

#### **T = 3:**
- The vehicle is halfway into the left lane.
- Position: (60, -3)

#### **T = 4:**
- The vehicle fully enters the left lane.
- Position: (80, -5)

#### **T = 5:**
- The vehicle passes the obstacle at X = 100 while staying in the left lane.
- Position: (100, -5)

#### **T = 6:**
- The vehicle continues moving forward in the left lane.
- Position: (120, -5)

#### **T = 7:**
- The vehicle starts shifting back to the right lane.
- Position: (140, -3)

#### **T = 8:**
- The vehicle continues shifting right.
- Position: (160, -2)

#### **T = 9:**
- The vehicle is halfway back to the right lane.
- Position: (180, -1)

#### **T = 10:**
- The vehicle fully returns to the right lane.
- Position: (200, 0)

### **Summary of Trajectory:**
| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -1)        |
| 2        | (40, -2)        |
| 3        | (60, -3)        |
| 4        | (80, -5)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -5)       |
| 7        | (140, -3)       |
| 8        | (160, -2)       |
| 9        | (180, -1)       |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

This trajectory ensures the vehicle safely changes lanes, avoids the obstacle, and returns to the original lane while maintaining highway speed.
