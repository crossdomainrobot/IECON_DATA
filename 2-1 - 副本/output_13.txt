To plan a safe trajectory for the vehicle to perform a double lane change maneuver and pass the obstacle safely, we need to carefully consider the dynamics of the vehicle while ensuring it stays within highway speed limits. Below is a detailed trajectory for the next 10 seconds.

### Key Assumptions:
1. **Initial Speed**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
2. **Highway Speed Limit**: Minimum speed = 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.
3. **Lane Width**: Y = 0 (right lane), Y = -5 (left lane).
4. **Obstacle Location**: (X = 100, Y = 0).

We will assume a smooth lateral transition using a sinusoidal-like trajectory for comfort and safety. The longitudinal velocity will remain near the initial speed of 20 m/s during the maneuver.

### Trajectory Plan:
#### T = 0: Initial Position
- Position: (0, 0)
- Velocity: (20 m/s longitudinally, 0 m/s laterally)

#### T = 1:
- Longitudinal position: X = 20 m (20 m/s ¡Á 1 s)
- Lateral position: Y = -1 m (gradual transition to left lane)
- Position: (20, -1)

#### T = 2:
- Longitudinal position: X = 40 m (20 m/s ¡Á 2 s)
- Lateral position: Y = -2.5 m (midpoint of transition to left lane)
- Position: (40, -2.5)

#### T = 3:
- Longitudinal position: X = 60 m (20 m/s ¡Á 3 s)
- Lateral position: Y = -4 m (almost fully in the left lane)
- Position: (60, -4)

#### T = 4:
- Longitudinal position: X = 80 m (20 m/s ¡Á 4 s)
- Lateral position: Y = -5 m (fully in the left lane)
- Position: (80, -5)

#### T = 5:
- Longitudinal position: X = 100 m (20 m/s ¡Á 5 s)
- Lateral position: Y = -5 m (still in the left lane, passing the obstacle at X = 100)
- Position: (100, -5)

#### T = 6:
- Longitudinal position: X = 120 m (20 m/s ¡Á 6 s)
- Lateral position: Y = -5 m (still in the left lane)
- Position: (120, -5)

#### T = 7:
- Longitudinal position: X = 140 m (20 m/s ¡Á 7 s)
- Lateral position: Y = -4 m (starting transition back to the right lane)
- Position: (140, -4)

#### T = 8:
- Longitudinal position: X = 160 m (20 m/s ¡Á 8 s)
- Lateral position: Y = -2.5 m (midpoint of transition back to the right lane)
- Position: (160, -2.5)

#### T = 9:
- Longitudinal position: X = 180 m (20 m/s ¡Á 9 s)
- Lateral position: Y = -1 m (almost fully in the right lane)
- Position: (180, -1)

#### T = 10:
- Longitudinal position: X = 200 m (20 m/s ¡Á 10 s)
- Lateral position: Y = 0 m (fully back in the right lane)
- Position: (200, 0)

### Summary of the Maneuver:
- From T = 0 to T = 4: Gradually move into the left lane.
- From T = 4 to T = 6: Fully in the left lane, passing the obstacle at X = 100.
- From T = 6 to T = 10: Gradually transition back to the right lane.

This trajectory ensures that the vehicle remains within highway speed limits, smoothly transitions lanes, and avoids the obstacle located at (X = 100, Y = 0). 

**Final Answer**: The positions at each second are as follows:
- T = 1: (20, -1)
- T = 2: (40, -2.5)
- T = 3: (60, -4)
- T = 4: (80, -5)
- T = 5: (100, -5)
- T = 6: (120, -5)
- T = 7: (140, -4)
- T = 8: (160, -2.5)
- T = 9: (180, -1)
- T = 10: (200, 0)
