To safely execute the double-lane change maneuver while maintaining highway speeds, we need to carefully plan the trajectory of the vehicle. The goal is to smoothly transition from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -5), pass the obstacle at X = 100, and then return to the right lane after clearing the obstacle. Below is a detailed trajectory for the next 10 seconds.

### Key Assumptions:
1. **Initial speed**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
2. **Lane width**: 5 meters (right lane: Y = 0, left lane: Y = -5).
3. **Highway speed constraint**: Maintain a velocity of at least 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.
4. **Lateral acceleration**: Smoothly adjust lateral position without excessive jerk.

### Trajectory Plan:
We will break the maneuver into three phases:
1. **Phase 1**: Transition from the right lane to the left lane (T = 0 to T = 5).
2. **Phase 2**: Stay in the left lane and overtake the obstacle (T = 5 to T = 8).
3. **Phase 3**: Transition back to the right lane (T = 8 to T = 10).

#### Phase 1: Lane Change to Left Lane (T = 0 to T = 5)
During this phase, the vehicle transitions from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -5). Simultaneously, it continues moving forward at approximately 20 m/s.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| T = 0    | (0, 0)          |
| T = 1    | (20, -1)        |
| T = 2    | (40, -2)        |
| T = 3    | (60, -3)        |
| T = 4    | (80, -4)        |
| T = 5    | (100, -5)       |

At T = 5, the vehicle has successfully entered the left lane just as it reaches the obstacle at X = 100.

---

#### Phase 2: Overtake Obstacle in Left Lane (T = 5 to T = 8)
During this phase, the vehicle remains in the left lane (Y = -5) and continues moving forward at approximately 20 m/s to clear the obstacle.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| T = 5    | (100, -5)       |
| T = 6    | (120, -5)       |
| T = 7    | (140, -5)       |
| T = 8    | (160, -5)       |

By T = 8, the vehicle has safely overtaken the obstacle.

---

#### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to Right Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)
During this phase, the vehicle transitions back from the left lane (Y = -5) to the right lane (Y = 0). It continues moving forward at approximately 20 m/s.

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| T = 8    | (160, -5)       |
| T = 9    | (180, -2.5)     |
| T = 10   | (200, 0)        |

By T = 10, the vehicle has returned to the right lane.

---

### Summary of Trajectory:
The vehicle follows the path below:

| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| T = 0    | (0, 0)          |
| T = 1    | (20, -1)        |
| T = 2    | (40, -2)        |
| T = 3    | (60, -3)        |
| T = 4    | (80, -4)        |
| T = 5    | (100, -5)       |
| T = 6    | (120, -5)       |
| T = 7    | (140, -5)       |
| T = 8    | (160, -5)       |
| T = 9    | (180, -2.5)     |
| T = 10   | (200, 0)        |

This trajectory ensures safe and smooth execution of the double-lane change maneuver while adhering to highway speed constraints.
