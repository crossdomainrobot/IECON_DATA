To safely execute the double lane change maneuver while maintaining highway speed constraints, we will carefully plan the trajectory of the vehicle. The goal is to smoothly transition from the right lane (Y = 0) to the left lane (Y = -5), pass the obstacle at X = 100, and then return to the right lane afterward. Below is a detailed trajectory for the next 10 seconds.

### Assumptions:
- Initial speed: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
- Minimum speed on the highway: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.
- Lateral movement (Y-axis) will be controlled using a smooth curve to ensure safety and comfort.
- Longitudinal movement (X-axis) will maintain a constant or slightly reduced speed during the lane change.

### Trajectory Plan:

#### **T = 0**
- Initial position: (0, 0)
- Speed: 20 m/s

#### **T = 1**
- Position: (20, -0.5)
- Speed: 20 m/s
- Start moving slightly to the left lane.

#### **T = 2**
- Position: (40, -2.0)
- Speed: 20 m/s
- Continue transitioning to the left lane.

#### **T = 3**
- Position: (60, -4.0)
- Speed: 20 m/s
- Fully enter the left lane.

#### **T = 4**
- Position: (80, -5.0)
- Speed: 20 m/s
- Stabilize in the left lane.

#### **T = 5**
- Position: (100, -5.0)
- Speed: 20 m/s
- Pass the obstacle safely while remaining in the left lane.

#### **T = 6**
- Position: (120, -5.0)
- Speed: 20 m/s
- Continue driving in the left lane after passing the obstacle.

#### **T = 7**
- Position: (140, -4.0)
- Speed: 20 m/s
- Begin transitioning back to the right lane.

#### **T = 8**
- Position: (160, -2.0)
- Speed: 20 m/s
- Continue moving toward the right lane.

#### **T = 9**
- Position: (180, -0.5)
- Speed: 20 m/s
- Almost fully back in the right lane.

#### **T = 10**
- Position: (200, 0.0)
- Speed: 20 m/s
- Successfully complete the double lane change maneuver.

### Summary of Key Points:
1. **Lane Change Timing**: The vehicle starts transitioning to the left lane at T = 1 and stabilizes in the left lane by T = 4.
2. **Obstacle Passing**: The vehicle passes the obstacle at T = 5 while fully in the left lane.
3. **Return to Right Lane**: The vehicle begins transitioning back to the right lane at T = 7 and completes the maneuver by T = 10.
4. **Speed Maintenance**: Throughout the maneuver, the vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h), ensuring compliance with highway speed regulations.

This trajectory ensures a safe and smooth double lane change while adhering to the constraints of highway driving.
