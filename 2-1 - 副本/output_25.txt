To safely navigate the double lane change maneuver while maintaining highway speeds and ensuring safety, I will plan a smooth trajectory that involves gradually moving into the left lane, passing the obstacle, and then returning to the right lane. Below is the planned trajectory for the vehicle's position (X, Y) at each second:

### Initial Conditions:
- **Initial Position:** (0, 0)
- **Initial Speed:** 72 km/h = 20 m/s
- **Obstacle Location:** (100, 0)

### Assumptions:
1. The vehicle will maintain a speed of approximately 20 m/s throughout the maneuver.
2. A smooth lateral transition (Y-axis movement) will be executed to avoid abrupt changes in direction.
3. The vehicle will stay in the left lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstacle at X = 100.

### Trajectory Plan:
#### **T = 0:**
- Position: (0, 0)  
- Speed: 20 m/s

#### **T = 1:**
- Position: (20, -1)  
- Description: Begin gradual transition to the left lane.

#### **T = 2:**
- Position: (40, -2)  
- Description: Continue lateral movement.

#### **T = 3:**
- Position: (60, -3)  
- Description: Progressing toward the left lane.

#### **T = 4:**
- Position: (80, -4)  
- Description: Nearing the left lane.

#### **T = 5:**
- Position: (100, -5)  
- Description: Fully in the left lane, passing the obstacle.

#### **T = 6:**
- Position: (120, -5)  
- Description: Continuing in the left lane, past the obstacle.

#### **T = 7:**
- Position: (140, -4)  
- Description: Starting to transition back to the right lane.

#### **T = 8:**
- Position: (160, -3)  
- Description: Continuing lateral movement toward the right lane.

#### **T = 9:**
- Position: (180, -2)  
- Description: Approaching the right lane.

#### **T = 10:**
- Position: (200, -1)  
- Description: Nearly back in the right lane.

### Final Maneuver Completion:
After T = 10 seconds, the vehicle will complete the transition back to the right lane by T ¡Ö 11 or 12 seconds. For example:
- **T = 11:** (220, 0)  
- **T = 12:** (240, 0)

By this point, the vehicle has successfully completed the double lane change maneuver, passed the obstacle safely, and returned to the right lane.

### Key Points:
1. The vehicle maintains a speed of approximately 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
2. The lateral movement (Y-axis) is gradual to ensure smooth transitions between lanes.
3. The vehicle stays in the left lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstacle at X = 100.  

This trajectory ensures safety and compliance with highway driving regulations.
