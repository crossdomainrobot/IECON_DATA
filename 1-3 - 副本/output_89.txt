To plan the route, we¡¯ll break down the vehicle¡¯s movement into phases: (1) traveling straight, (2) transitioning to the adjacent lane, (3) bypassing the obstruction, (4) transitioning back to the original lane, and (5) continuing straight. We¡¯ll use the given spatial reference system and maintain a speed above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).

### Key Assumptions:
- **Speed**: Maintain a constant speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) for simplicity.
- **Lane Width**: The adjacent lane is at \( Y = -5 \), meaning the lane width is 5 meters.
- **Obstruction**: Located at \( (100, 0) \).
- **Time Frame**: Plan for the next 10 seconds.

### Step-by-Step Plan:

#### Phase 1: Travel Straight (T = 0 to T = 2.5 seconds)
- Move straight in the outer lane (\( Y = 0 \)) until approaching the obstruction.
- Distance covered: \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \times 2.5 \, \text{s} = 50 \, \text{m} \).
- Position at \( T = 2.5 \): \( (50, 0) \).

#### Phase 2: Transition to Adjacent Lane (T = 2.5 to T = 5 seconds)
- Gradually move to the adjacent lane (\( Y = -5 \)) over 2.5 seconds.
- Lateral movement: \( Y \) changes linearly from 0 to -5.
- Distance covered: \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \times 2.5 \, \text{s} = 50 \, \text{m} \).
- Position at \( T = 5 \): \( (100, -5) \).

#### Phase 3: Bypass the Obstruction (T = 5 to T = 7.5 seconds)
- Continue in the adjacent lane (\( Y = -5 \)) to bypass the obstruction.
- Distance covered: \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \times 2.5 \, \text{s} = 50 \, \text{m} \).
- Position at \( T = 7.5 \): \( (150, -5) \).

#### Phase 4: Transition Back to Original Lane (T = 7.5 to T = 10 seconds)
- Gradually move back to the original lane (\( Y = 0 \)) over 2.5 seconds.
- Lateral movement: \( Y \) changes linearly from -5 to 0.
- Distance covered: \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \times 2.5 \, \text{s} = 50 \, \text{m} \).
- Position at \( T = 10 \): \( (200, 0) \).

---

### Estimated Positions at Critical Intervals:
- \( T = 0 \): \( (0, 0) \)
- \( T = 1 \): \( (20, 0) \)
- \( T = 2 \): \( (40, 0) \)
- \( T = 3 \): \( (60, -2) \)
- \( T = 4 \): \( (80, -4) \)
- \( T = 5 \): \( (100, -5) \)
- \( T = 6 \): \( (120, -5) \)
- \( T = 7 \): \( (140, -5) \)
- \( T = 8 \): \( (160, -3) \)
- \( T = 9 \): \( (180, -1) \)
- \( T = 10 \): \( (200, 0) \)

---

### Summary:
- The vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane between \( T = 2.5 \) and \( T = 5 \), bypasses the obstruction at \( X = 100 \), and transitions back to the original lane between \( T = 7.5 \) and \( T = 10 \).
- The speed remains constant at 72 km/h throughout the maneuver.
