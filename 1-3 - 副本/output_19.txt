To construct a route planning for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Transition to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Returning to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**

### Given:
- **Initial Position (T = 0)**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)  
- **Obstruction Position**: (100, 0)  
- **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5  
- **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h (20 m/s)  
- **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)  
- **Time Interval**: 10 seconds  

### Assumptions:
- Lane transitions take 2 seconds each (smooth lateral movement).  
- The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) during the maneuver.  
- The obstruction is bypassed between X = 100 and X = 120.

---

### Step-by-Step Route Planning:

#### **Phase 1: Transition to the Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2)**  
- **Lateral Movement**: From Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.  
- **Longitudinal Movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.  

**Positions**:  
- **T = 1**: X = 20, Y = -2.5  
- **T = 2**: X = 40, Y = -5  

---

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)**  
- **Lateral Movement**: Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
- **Longitudinal Movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.  

**Positions**:  
- **T = 3**: X = 60, Y = -5  
- **T = 4**: X = 80, Y = -5  
- **T = 5**: X = 100, Y = -5  
- **T = 6**: X = 120, Y = -5  

---

#### **Phase 3: Return to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)**  
- **Lateral Movement**: From Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.  
- **Longitudinal Movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.  

**Positions**:  
- **T = 7**: X = 140, Y = -2.5  
- **T = 8**: X = 160, Y = 0  

---

#### **Phase 4: Continue in the Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)**  
- **Lateral Movement**: Stay in the original lane (Y = 0).  
- **Longitudinal Movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.  

**Positions**:  
- **T = 9**: X = 180, Y = 0  
- **T = 10**: X = 200, Y = 0  

---

### Summary of Positions (X, Y) at Each Second:
| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |
| 2        | 40    | -5    |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |
| 8        | 160   | 0     |
| 9        | 180   | 0     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction safely while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h and smoothly transitions between lanes.
