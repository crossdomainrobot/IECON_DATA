To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed exceeding 60 km/h, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Transition to the adjacent lane** (from Y = 0 to Y = -5).  
2. **Bypass the obstruction** (stay in the adjacent lane until X > 100).  
3. **Return to the original lane** (from Y = -5 back to Y = 0).

### Assumptions:
- The vehicle¡¯s initial speed is 72 km/h (20 m/s).  
- The speed must remain above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s) throughout.  
- The lateral movement (changing lanes) occurs smoothly over a reasonable distance.

### Step-by-Step Plan:
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at 1-second intervals (T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10).

#### **Phase 1: Transition to the adjacent lane (T = 0 to T = 3)**
- Goal: Move from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds.  
- Lateral velocity: \( \Delta Y = \frac{-5}{3} \approx -1.67 \, \text{m/s} \).  
- Longitudinal velocity: Maintain 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m)       | Y (m)       |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 0        | 0           | 0           |
| 1        | 20          | -1.67       |
| 2        | 40          | -3.33       |
| 3        | 60          | -5          |

#### **Phase 2: Bypass the obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7)**
- Goal: Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstruction at X = 100.  
- Longitudinal velocity: Maintain 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m)       | Y (m)       |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 3        | 60          | -5          |
| 4        | 80          | -5          |
| 5        | 100         | -5          |
| 6        | 120         | -5          |
| 7        | 140         | -5          |

---

#### **Phase 3: Return to the original lane (T = 7 to T = 10)**
- Goal: Move from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.  
- Lateral velocity: \( \Delta Y = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67 \, \text{m/s} \).  
- Longitudinal velocity: Maintain 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m)       | Y (m)       |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 7        | 140         | -5          |
| 8        | 160         | -3.33       |
| 9        | 180         | -1.67       |
| 10       | 200         | 0           |

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m)  |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 0        | 0     | 0      |
| 1        | 20    | -1.67  |
| 2        | 40    | -3.33  |
| 3        | 60    | -5     |
| 4        | 80    | -5     |
| 5        | 100   | -5     |
| 6        | 120   | -5     |
| 7        | 140   | -5     |
| 8        | 160   | -3.33  |
| 9        | 180   | -1.67  |
| 10       | 200   | 0      |

### Verification:
- Speed is maintained at 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout, which exceeds the minimum requirement of 16.67 m/s (60 km/h).  
- The obstruction at X = 100 is bypassed while staying in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
- The vehicle returns to the original lane (Y = 0) by T = 10 seconds.  

This plan ensures a safe and smooth maneuver around the obstruction.
