To plan the route, we¡¯ll break down the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane**: Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction**: Maintain the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstruction at X = 100.  
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane**: Transition back from the adjacent lane (Y = -5) to the original lane (Y = 0).  

### Assumptions:
- Initial speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s).  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).  
- Lane change duration: 2 seconds for each transition (to and from the adjacent lane).  
- Total maneuver time: 10 seconds.  

### Route Planning:
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle's position (X, Y) at 1-second intervals.

---

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2)**  
- **X-coordinate**: Moves at a constant speed of 20 m/s.  
  \( X(T) = X(0) + 20 \cdot T \)  
- **Y-coordinate**: Changes linearly from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.  
  \( Y(T) = -2.5 \cdot T \)  

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 8)**  
- **X-coordinate**: Continues at 20 m/s.  
  \( X(T) = X(2) + 20 \cdot (T - 2) \)  
- **Y-coordinate**: Remains at Y = -5.  

#### **Phase 3: Lane Change Back to Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)**  
- **X-coordinate**: Continues at 20 m/s.  
  \( X(T) = X(8) + 20 \cdot (T - 8) \)  
- **Y-coordinate**: Changes linearly from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.  
  \( Y(T) = -5 + 2.5 \cdot (T - 8) \)

#### **Positions at Critical Intervals:**

| Time (T) | X-coordinate (m) | Y-coordinate (m) | Phase Description                     |
|----------|------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 0        | 0                | 0                | Start in the outer lane (Y = 0).      |
| 1        | 20               | -2.5             | Transitioning to the adjacent lane.   |
| 2        | 40               | -5               | Fully in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  |
| 3        | 60               | -5               | Bypassing the obstruction.            |
| 4        | 80               | -5               | Bypassing the obstruction.            |
| 5        | 100              | -5               | Passing the obstruction at X = 100.   |
| 6        | 120              | -5               | Bypassing the obstruction.            |
| 7        | 140              | -5               | Bypassing the obstruction.            |
| 8        | 160              | -5               | Preparing to transition back.         |
| 9        | 180              | -2.5             | Transitioning back to the outer lane. |
| 10       | 200              | 0                | Fully back in the outer lane (Y = 0). |

### Summary:
- The vehicle successfully bypasses the obstruction at X = 100 while maintaining a speed of 72 km/h.  
- Lane changes are completed smoothly within the 10-second timeframe.  
- The route ensures the vehicle remains above the minimum speed of 60 km/h throughout the maneuver.
