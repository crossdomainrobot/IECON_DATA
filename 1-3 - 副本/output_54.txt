To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases: transitioning to the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. We¡¯ll use the given spatial reference system and assume constant velocity (72 km/h = 20 m/s) for simplicity.

### Phase 1: Transition to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)
- **Time**: 0 to 2 seconds (assume smooth lane change takes 2 seconds).
- **X Position**: Increases linearly at 20 m/s.
- **Y Position**: Transitions from 0 to -5 linearly.

### Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction (X = 100)
- **Time**: 2 to 6 seconds.
- **X Position**: Continues to increase linearly at 20 m/s.
- **Y Position**: Remains at -5.

### Phase 3: Return to the Original Lane (Y = 0)
- **Time**: 6 to 8 seconds.
- **X Position**: Continues to increase linearly at 20 m/s.
- **Y Position**: Transitions from -5 to 0 linearly.

### Position Estimates at Critical Intervals
Here¡¯s the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at each second:

- **T = 0s**: (0, 0)  
  Starting point in the outer lane.

- **T = 1s**: (20, -2.5)  
  Midway through lane change.

- **T = 2s**: (40, -5)  
  Fully in the adjacent lane.

- **T = 3s**: (60, -5)  
  Bypassing the obstruction.

- **T = 4s**: (80, -5)  
  Bypassing the obstruction.

- **T = 5s**: (100, -5)  
  Passing the obstruction.

- **T = 6s**: (120, -5)  
  Bypassing the obstruction.

- **T = 7s**: (140, -2.5)  
  Midway through returning to the original lane.

- **T = 8s**: (160, 0)  
  Fully back in the original lane.

- **T = 9s**: (180, 0)  
  Continuing in the original lane.

- **T = 10s**: (200, 0)  
  Continuing in the original lane.

### Summary of the Maneuver
1. **Lane Change (0 to 2s)**: Smoothly transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
2. **Bypass Obstruction (2 to 6s)**: Maintain Y = -5 while passing X = 100.
3. **Return to Original Lane (6 to 8s)**: Smoothly transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0.
4. **Continue Driving (8 to 10s)**: Maintain Y = 0.

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) throughout the maneuver.
