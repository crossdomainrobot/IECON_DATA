To construct a route planning for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed exceeding 60 km/h, we'll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).**
2. **Bypass the obstruction (X = 100).**
3. **Return to the original lane (Y = 0).**

### Key Assumptions:
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.
- Time step: 1 second (¦¤t = 1s).
- Assume constant acceleration/deceleration for simplicity.

### Phase 1: Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5)
- **Duration:** 2 seconds (T = 0 to T = 2).
- **Lateral movement:** From Y = 0 to Y = -5.
- **Lateral velocity:** ¦¤Y = -5/2 = -2.5 m/s.
- **Longitudinal velocity:** Maintain 20 m/s.

#### Positions:
- **T = 0s:** (X = 0, Y = 0).
- **T = 1s:** (X = 20, Y = -2.5).
- **T = 2s:** (X = 40, Y = -5).

---

### Phase 2: Bypass the obstruction (X = 100)
- **Duration:** 3 seconds (T = 2 to T = 5).
- **Lateral movement:** Stay at Y = -5.
- **Longitudinal velocity:** Maintain 20 m/s.

#### Positions:
- **T = 3s:** (X = 60, Y = -5).
- **T = 4s:** (X = 80, Y = -5).
- **T = 5s:** (X = 100, Y = -5).

---

### Phase 3: Return to the original lane (Y = 0)
- **Duration:** 3 seconds (T = 5 to T = 8).
- **Lateral movement:** From Y = -5 to Y = 0.
- **Lateral velocity:** ¦¤Y = 5/3 ¡Ö 1.67 m/s.
- **Longitudinal velocity:** Maintain 20 m/s.

#### Positions:
- **T = 6s:** (X = 120, Y = -3.33).
- **T = 7s:** (X = 140, Y = -1.67).
- **T = 8s:** (X = 160, Y = 0).

---

### Post-Maneuver: Continue in the original lane
- **Duration:** 2 seconds (T = 8 to T = 10).
- **Lateral movement:** Stay at Y = 0.
- **Longitudinal velocity:** Maintain 20 m/s.

#### Positions:
- **T = 9s:** (X = 180, Y = 0).
- **T = 10s:** (X = 200, Y = 0).

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |
| 2        | 40    | -5    |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -3.33 |
| 7        | 140   | -1.67 |
| 8        | 160   | 0     |
| 9        | 180   | 0     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
