To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the process into three phases: transitioning to the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. We¡¯ll use the spatial reference system \((X, Y)\) and ensure the vehicle¡¯s speed remains above 60 km/h throughout.

### **Given Parameters**
- **Initial Position**: \((X, Y) = (0, 0)\)
- **Obstruction**: Located at \((100, 0)\)
- **Adjacent Lane**: \(Y = -5\)
- **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum Speed**: Must exceed 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- **Time Intervals**: 1-second increments for 10 seconds

---

### **Assumptions**
1. The vehicle accelerates/decelerates smoothly for lane transitions.
2. Lane transitions take 2 seconds each (1 second to enter the adjacent lane, 1 second to stabilize).
3. The vehicle bypasses the obstruction while staying in the adjacent lane (\(Y = -5\)) from \(X = 80\) to \(X = 120\).

---

### **Phase 1: Transition to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2)**
- **Objective**: Move from \(Y = 0\) to \(Y = -5\) over 2 seconds.
- **Position at T = 1**: \((20, -2.5)\) (halfway into the lane transition).
- **Position at T = 2**: \((40, -5)\) (fully in the adjacent lane).

---

### **Phase 2: Bypass Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)**
- **Objective**: Stay in the adjacent lane (\(Y = -5\)) while bypassing the obstruction at \(X = 100\).
- **Position at T = 3**: \((60, -5)\)
- **Position at T = 4**: \((80, -5)\)
- **Position at T = 5**: \((100, -5)\) (bypassing the obstruction).
- **Position at T = 6**: \((120, -5)\) (clear of the obstruction).

---

### **Phase 3: Return to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)**
- **Objective**: Move from \(Y = -5\) to \(Y = 0\) over 2 seconds.
- **Position at T = 7**: \((140, -2.5)\) (halfway into the lane transition).
- **Position at T = 8**: \((160, 0)\) (fully in the original lane).

---

### **Phase 4: Continue in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)**
- **Objective**: Maintain position in the original lane (\(Y = 0\)).
- **Position at T = 9**: \((180, 0)\)
- **Position at T = 10**: \((200, 0)\).

### **Summary of Positions at Critical Intervals**
| Time (s) | Position \((X, Y)\) |
|----------|---------------------|
| T = 0    | \((0, 0)\)          |
| T = 1    | \((20, -2.5)\)      |
| T = 2    | \((40, -5)\)        |
| T = 3    | \((60, -5)\)        |
| T = 4    | \((80, -5)\)        |
| T = 5    | \((100, -5)\)       |
| T = 6    | \((120, -5)\)       |
| T = 7    | \((140, -2.5)\)     |
| T = 8    | \((160, 0)\)        |
| T = 9    | \((180, 0)\)        |
| T = 10   | \((200, 0)\)        |

### **Verification of Speed**
- The vehicle travels 200 meters in 10 seconds, maintaining an average speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h), which exceeds the minimum required speed of 16.67 m/s (60 km/h).

This plan ensures safe and efficient navigation around the obstruction.
