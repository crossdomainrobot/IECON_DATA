To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Transition Phase**: Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
2. **Bypass Phase**: Continue in the adjacent lane until the obstruction is bypassed (X = 100).
3. **Return Phase**: Transition back to the outer lane (Y = 0).

### Assumptions:
- Vehicle speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s).
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).
- Obstruction is at X = 100 meters.
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).
- Lane change duration: 2 seconds (smooth transition).

### Time Intervals:
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals for the first 10 seconds.

### Phase 1: Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)
- **Goal**: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 in 2 seconds.
- **Y-position**: Linear interpolation from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
- **X-position**: Constant speed of 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X-position (m) | Y-position (m) |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| 0        | 0              | 0              |
| 1        | 20             | -2.5           |
| 2        | 40             | -5             |

---

### Phase 2: Bypass (T = 2 to T = 7 seconds)
- **Goal**: Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until X > 100.
- **X-position**: Constant speed of 20 m/s.
- **Y-position**: Constant at Y = -5.

| Time (s) | X-position (m) | Y-position (m) |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| 3        | 60             | -5             |
| 4        | 80             | -5             |
| 5        | 100            | -5             |
| 6        | 120            | -5             |
| 7        | 140            | -5             |

---

### Phase 3: Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 9 seconds)
- **Goal**: Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 in 2 seconds.
- **Y-position**: Linear interpolation from Y = -5 to Y = 0.
- **X-position**: Constant speed of 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X-position (m) | Y-position (m) |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| 8        | 160            | -2.5           |
| 9        | 180            | 0              |

---

### Final Position at T = 10 seconds
- **Goal**: Continue in the original lane (Y = 0).
- **X-position**: Constant speed of 20 m/s.
- **Y-position**: Constant at Y = 0.

| Time (s) | X-position (m) | Y-position (m) |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| 10       | 200            | 0              |

---

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | X-position (m) | Y-position (m) |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| 0        | 0              | 0              |
| 1        | 20             | -2.5           |
| 2        | 40             | -5             |
| 3        | 60             | -5             |
| 4        | 80             | -5             |
| 5        | 100            | -5             |
| 6        | 120            | -5             |
| 7        | 140            | -5             |
| 8        | 160            | -2.5           |
| 9        | 180            | 0              |
| 10       | 200            | 0              |

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
