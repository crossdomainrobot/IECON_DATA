To plan the route, we'll break the maneuver into three phases: transitioning to the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. Here's the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Given:**
- **Initial position:** (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Obstruction position:** (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate:** Y = -5
- **Initial velocity:** 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum speed:** 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- **Time intervals:** T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 seconds

---

### **Phase 1: Transition to the adjacent lane (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)**
- **Goal:** Move from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
- **Time taken:** Assume 3 seconds for a smooth lane change.
- **X-position:** Vehicle continues moving forward at 20 m/s.
- **Y-position:** Linearly transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds.

| Time (s) | X (m)        | Y (m)       |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| 0        | 0            | 0           |
| 1        | 20           | -1.67       |
| 2        | 40           | -3.33       |
| 3        | 60           | -5          |

---

### **Phase 2: Bypass the obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7 seconds)**
- **Goal:** Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstruction at X = 100.
- **X-position:** Vehicle continues moving forward at 20 m/s.
- **Y-position:** Constant at Y = -5.

| Time (s) | X (m)        | Y (m)       |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| 3        | 60           | -5          |
| 4        | 80           | -5          |
| 5        | 100          | -5          |
| 6        | 120          | -5          |
| 7        | 140          | -5          |

---

### **Phase 3: Return to the original lane (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds)**
- **Goal:** Move from Y = -5 to Y = 0.
- **Time taken:** Assume 3 seconds for a smooth lane change.
- **X-position:** Vehicle continues moving forward at 20 m/s.
- **Y-position:** Linearly transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.

| Time (s) | X (m)        | Y (m)       |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| 7        | 140          | -5          |
| 8        | 160          | -3.33       |
| 9        | 180          | -1.67       |
| 10       | 200          | 0           |

---

### **Final Route Plan:**

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m)  |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 0        | 0     | 0      |
| 1        | 20    | -1.67  |
| 2        | 40    | -3.33  |
| 3        | 60    | -5     |
| 4        | 80    | -5     |
| 5        | 100   | -5     |
| 6        | 120   | -5     |
| 7        | 140   | -5     |
| 8        | 160   | -3.33  |
| 9        | 180   | -1.67  |
| 10       | 200   | 0      |

### **Summary:**
- The vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane by T = 3 seconds.
- It bypasses the obstruction at X = 100 while staying in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
- It returns to the original lane by T = 10 seconds.
- The speed remains constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h), satisfying the minimum speed requirement.
