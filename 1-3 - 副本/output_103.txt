### **Understanding the Scenario**

First, let's break down the information provided:

- **Road Structure**: There are two parallel lanes. I'm currently in the outer lane.
- **Obstruction**: Detected 100 meters ahead directly in my path at coordinates (100, 0).
- **Lane Transition**: To bypass the obstruction, I need to move to the adjacent lane (Y = -5), go around the blockage, and then return to my original lane (Y = 0).
- **Vehicle's Starting Point**: (0, 0).
- **Speed**: Initial velocity is 72 km/h, and I must maintain a speed exceeding 60 km/h throughout the maneuver.
- **Time Frame**: Need to plan the route over the next 10 seconds, with position estimates at each second.

### **Converting Speed to Meters per Second**

Since the distances are in meters and time in seconds, it's practical to convert the speed from km/h to m/s.

\[ 72 \text{ km/h} = 72 \times \frac{1000 \text{ meters}}{3600 \text{ seconds}} = 20 \text{ m/s} \]

Similarly, the minimum speed:

\[ 60 \text{ km/h} = 60 \times \frac{1000}{3600} \approx 16.67 \text{ m/s} \]

### **Planning the Lane Transition**

To navigate around the obstruction, I'll need to:

1. **Change to the adjacent lane (Y = -5)** before reaching the obstruction.
2. **Bypass the obstruction** while staying in the adjacent lane.
3. **Return to the original lane (Y = 0)** after passing the obstruction.

### **Estimating Position Over Time**

Assuming a constant speed of 20 m/s, I'll calculate the vehicle's X position every second. The Y position will change as I transition between lanes.

#### **Time Intervals and Positions**

Let's create a table to estimate the vehicle's position at each second from T = 0 to T = 10.

| Time (s) | X Position (m) | Y Position (m) | Notes |
|----------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| 0        | 0              | 0              | Starting point. |
| 1        | 20             | 0              | Continue in the original lane. |
| 2        | 40             | 0              | Still in the original lane. |
| 3        | 60             | -1.25          | Begin transitioning to the adjacent lane (Y = -5). |
| 4        | 80             | -2.5           | Continue transitioning. |
| 5        | 100            | -5             | Fully in the adjacent lane; bypassing obstruction. |
| 6        | 120            | -5             | Continue in the adjacent lane past the obstruction. |
| 7        | 140            | -3.75          | Begin transitioning back to the original lane. |
| 8        | 160            | -2.5           | Continue transitioning back. |
| 9        | 180            | -1.25          | Nearly back to the original lane. |
| 10       | 200            | 0              | Fully returned to the original lane. |

#### **Detailed Steps**

1. **T = 0 to T = 2**:
   - **X**: Increases by 20 m/s.
   - **Y**: Remains at 0. I stay in the original lane as I approach the obstruction.

2. **T = 3 to T = 4**:
   - **X**: Continues to increase.
   - **Y**: Begins transitioning from 0 to -5. To achieve this smoothly, I'll change lanes linearly over 2 seconds.
     - From T = 3 to T = 5, Y changes from 0 to -5.
     - Rate of change: \( \frac{-5}{2} = -2.5 \, \text{m/s} \).

3. **T = 5**:
   - **X**: Reaches 100 m, directly where the obstruction is.
   - **Y**: At -5, fully in the adjacent lane, successfully bypassing the obstruction.

4. **T = 6**:
   - **X**: Continues past the obstruction.
   - **Y**: Remains at -5, staying in the adjacent lane.

5. **T = 7 to T = 9**:
   - **X**: Continues to increase.
   - **Y**: Begins transitioning back from -5 to 0 over 3 seconds.
     - From T = 7 to T = 10, Y changes from -5 to 0.
     - Rate of change: \( \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67 \, \text{m/s} \).

6. **T = 10**:
   - **X**: Reaches 200 m.
   - **Y**: Back at 0, fully returned to the original lane.

### **Ensuring Speed Constraints**

Throughout the maneuver, the speed remains at 20 m/s (72 km/h), which exceeds the minimum required speed of 16.67 m/s (60 km/h). Therefore, the speed constraint is satisfied.

### **Final Position Estimates**

Summarizing the vehicle's position at each second:

| Time (s) | X Position (m) | Y Position (m) |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| 0        | 0              | 0              |
| 1        | 20             | 0              |
| 2        | 40             | 0              |
| 3        | 60             | -1.25          |
| 4        | 80             | -2.5           |
| 5        | 100            | -5             |
| 6        | 120            | -5             |
| 7        | 140            | -3.75          |
| 8        | 160            | -2.5           |
| 9        | 180            | -1.25          |
| 10       | 200            | 0              |

### **Visualization**

To better understand the vehicle's path, let's plot the positions:

1. **From T = 0 to T = 2**: Moves straight along the X-axis, Y remains 0.
2. **From T = 3 to T = 5**: Gradually shifts from Y = 0 to Y = -5 while moving forward.
3. **At T = 5**: Directly in front of the obstruction at X = 100, Y = -5.
4. **From T = 6 to T = 10**: Moves past the obstruction and transitions back to Y = 0.

### **Conclusion**

By planning the lane transitions over specific time intervals, I ensure a smooth bypass of the obstruction while maintaining the required speed. Here's the final route planned:

- **T = 0**: Start at (0, 0).
- **T = 1**: (20, 0).
- **T = 2**: (40, 0).
- **T = 3**: (60, -1.25).
- **T = 4**: (80, -2.5).
- **T = 5**: (100, -5).
- **T = 6**: (120, -5).
- **T = 7**: (140, -3.75).
- **T = 8**: (160, -2.5).
- **T = 9**: (180, -1.25).
- **T = 10**: (200, 0).

This plan allows me to navigate around the obstruction safely and efficiently.
