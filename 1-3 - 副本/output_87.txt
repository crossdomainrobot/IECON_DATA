To plan the route, we¡¯ll break down the vehicle¡¯s movement into phases, considering its speed, lane transitions, and the obstruction. The vehicle¡¯s initial velocity is **72 km/h**, which is **20 m/s** (since 72 km/h = 20 m/s). We¡¯ll assume constant speed for simplicity.

### Route Phases:
1. **Travel in the outer lane (Y = 0) until approaching the obstruction.**
2. **Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) to bypass the obstruction.**
3. **Stay in the adjacent lane until the obstruction is cleared.**
4. **Transition back to the outer lane (Y = 0).**

### Critical Points:
- **Obstruction at (100, 0):** The vehicle needs to start transitioning to the adjacent lane before reaching this point.
- **Transition timing:** Assume smooth transitions over 2 seconds each (lane changes take time).

### Step-by-Step Position Estimates:
1. **At T = 0 s:**  
   Vehicle starts at (0, 0).  
   Velocity: 20 m/s.

2. **At T = 1 s:**  
   X = 20 m, Y = 0.  
   Vehicle continues in the outer lane.

3. **At T = 2 s:**  
   X = 40 m, Y = 0.  
   Vehicle continues in the outer lane.

4. **At T = 3 s:**  
   X = 60 m, Y = 0.  
   Vehicle continues in the outer lane.

5. **At T = 4 s:**  
   X = 80 m, Y = 0.  
   Vehicle begins transitioning to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
   Transition takes 2 seconds, so Y = -2.5 at T = 4 s.

6. **At T = 5 s:**  
   X = 100 m, Y = -5.  
   Vehicle fully enters the adjacent lane.  
   Obstruction is bypassed.

7. **At T = 6 s:**  
   X = 120 m, Y = -5.  
   Vehicle continues in the adjacent lane.

8. **At T = 7 s:**  
   X = 140 m, Y = -5.  
   Vehicle continues in the adjacent lane.

9. **At T = 8 s:**  
   X = 160 m, Y = -5.  
   Vehicle begins transitioning back to the outer lane (Y = 0).  
   Transition takes 2 seconds, so Y = -2.5 at T = 8 s.

10. **At T = 9 s:**  
    X = 180 m, Y = 0.  
    Vehicle fully returns to the outer lane.

11. **At T = 10 s:**  
    X = 200 m, Y = 0.  
    Vehicle continues in the outer lane.

### Key Notes:
- The vehicle maintains a speed of **20 m/s (72 km/h)**, exceeding the required minimum of **60 km/h**.
- Lane transitions are smooth and take **2 seconds** each.
- The obstruction at (100, 0) is bypassed by transitioning to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) at T = 4 s.
