To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into phases: transitioning to the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. We¡¯ll use the (X, Y) coordinate system and assume constant speed for simplicity.

### **Given:**
- **Initial position:** (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Obstruction position:** (X, Y) = (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate:** Y = -5
- **Initial velocity:** 72 km/h = 20 m/s
- **Minimum speed:** 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s
- **Time interval:** 10 seconds (T = 0 to T = 10)

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s.
2. Lane transitions take 2 seconds each (smooth lateral movement).
3. The vehicle bypasses the obstruction between X = 90 m and X = 110 m (to ensure safety).

### **Route Plan:**

#### **Phase 1: Transition to the Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2)**
- **Lateral movement:** Y transitions linearly from 0 to -5 over 2 seconds.
- **Position at T = 1:** (X, Y) = (20, -2.5)
- **Position at T = 2:** (X, Y) = (40, -5)

#### **Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)**
- **Lateral movement:** Y remains at -5.
- **Position at T = 3:** (X, Y) = (60, -5)
- **Position at T = 4:** (X, Y) = (80, -5)
- **Position at T = 5:** (X, Y) = (100, -5)
- **Position at T = 6:** (X, Y) = (120, -5)

#### **Phase 3: Return to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)**
- **Lateral movement:** Y transitions linearly from -5 to 0 over 2 seconds.
- **Position at T = 7:** (X, Y) = (140, -2.5)
- **Position at T = 8:** (X, Y) = (160, 0)

#### **Phase 4: Continue in the Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)**
- **Lateral movement:** Y remains at 0.
- **Position at T = 9:** (X, Y) = (180, 0)
- **Position at T = 10:** (X, Y) = (200, 0)

### **Summary of Positions:**
| Time (T) | X Position (m) | Y Position (m) |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| 0        | 0              | 0              |
| 1        | 20             | -2.5           |
| 2        | 40             | -5             |
| 3        | 60             | -5             |
| 4        | 80             | -5             |
| 5        | 100            | -5             |
| 6        | 120            | -5             |
| 7        | 140            | -2.5           |
| 8        | 160            | 0              |
| 9        | 180            | 0              |
| 10       | 200            | 0              |

### **Key Points:**
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s throughout.
2. Lane transitions are smooth and completed within 2 seconds each.
3. The obstruction is safely bypassed between X = 90 m and X = 110 m.
4. The vehicle returns to the original lane by T = 8 and continues its journey.
