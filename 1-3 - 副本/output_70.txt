To plan the route, we¡¯ll break down the vehicle¡¯s movement into three phases:

1. **Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5)**:  
   - This involves changing lanes from Y = 0 to Y = -5 while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
   
2. **Bypass the obstruction (X = 100)**:  
   - Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until the obstruction is cleared.

3. **Return to the original lane (Y = 0)**:  
   - Transition back to the original lane after bypassing the obstruction.

### Assumptions:
- The vehicle¡¯s speed is constant at 72 km/h (20 m/s) throughout the maneuver.
- Lane changes are smooth and instantaneous for simplicity.
- The obstruction is at X = 100, and the adjacent lane is at Y = -5.

### Calculations:
1. **Time to reach the obstruction**:  
   Distance to obstruction = 100 m.  
   Speed = 20 m/s.  
   Time to reach obstruction = \( \frac{100}{20} = 5 \) seconds.  

2. **Time to bypass the obstruction**:  
   The vehicle must stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until it clears the obstruction at X = 100.

3. **Time to return to the original lane**:  
   After bypassing the obstruction, the vehicle transitions back to Y = 0.

### Route Planning:
We¡¯ll outline the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at 1-second intervals.

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) | Description                          |
|----------|-------|-------|--------------------------------------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     | Starting position in the outer lane. |
| 1        | 20    | 0     | Moving forward in the outer lane.    |
| 2        | 40    | 0     | Moving forward in the outer lane.    |
| 3        | 60    | -5    | Transition to the adjacent lane.     |
| 4        | 80    | -5    | Moving forward in the adjacent lane. |
| 5        | 100   | -5    | Bypassing the obstruction.           |
| 6        | 120   | -5    | Moving forward in the adjacent lane. |
| 7        | 140   | 0     | Transition back to the outer lane.   |
| 8        | 160   | 0     | Moving forward in the outer lane.    |
| 9        | 180   | 0     | Moving forward in the outer lane.    |
| 10       | 200   | 0     | Moving forward in the outer lane.    |

### Summary:
- **T = 0 to T = 2**: The vehicle travels in the outer lane (Y = 0).  
- **T = 3**: The vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
- **T = 4 to T = 6**: The vehicle bypasses the obstruction in the adjacent lane.  
- **T = 7**: The vehicle transitions back to the outer lane (Y = 0).  
- **T = 8 to T = 10**: The vehicle continues in the outer lane.  

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h and safely navigates around the obstruction.
