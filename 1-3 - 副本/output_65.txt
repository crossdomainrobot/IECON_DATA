To construct a route planning for your vehicle, we¡¯ll break down the maneuver into key phases: initial travel, lane transition, bypassing the obstruction, returning to the original lane, and continuing forward. We¡¯ll calculate your position at 1-second intervals while ensuring your speed remains above 60 km/h.

### **Given:**
- **Initial position:** (X, Y) = (0, 0) at T = 0
- **Obstruction position:** (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate:** Y = -5
- **Initial speed:** 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum speed:** 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- **Time interval:** 1 second

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. **Lane transition time:** It takes 2 seconds to safely transition between lanes.
2. **Bypassing the obstruction:** You stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until you¡¯ve fully passed the obstruction at X = 100.
3. **Speed adjustments:** You maintain a constant speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) throughout the maneuver.

### **Route Planning:**

#### **Phase 1: Initial Travel (T = 0 to T = 3)**
- At T = 0: (0, 0)
- At T = 1: (20, 0)
- At T = 2: (40, 0)
- At T = 3: (60, 0)
  - Begin transitioning to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).

#### **Phase 2: Lane Transition (T = 3 to T = 5)**
- At T = 3: (60, 0)
- At T = 4: (80, -2.5)
- At T = 5: (100, -5)
  - Fully in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).

#### **Phase 3: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 5 to T = 7)**
- At T = 5: (100, -5)
- At T = 6: (120, -5)
- At T = 7: (140, -5)
  - Obstruction is now behind you.

#### **Phase 4: Returning to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 9)**
- At T = 7: (140, -5)
- At T = 8: (160, -2.5)
- At T = 9: (180, 0)
  - Fully back in the original lane (Y = 0).

#### **Phase 5: Continuing Forward (T = 9 to T = 10)**
- At T = 9: (180, 0)
- At T = 10: (200, 0)

### **Summary of Positions:**
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|-----------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, 0)         |
| 2        | (40, 0)         |
| 3        | (60, 0)         |
| 4        | (80, -2.5)      |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -5)       |
| 7        | (140, -5)       |
| 8        | (160, -2.5)     |
| 9        | (180, 0)        |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |
