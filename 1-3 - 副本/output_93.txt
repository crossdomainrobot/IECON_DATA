To plan the route, we¡¯ll break down the vehicle¡¯s movement into three phases:  
1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane** (Y = -5).  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction** while staying in the adjacent lane.  
3. **Returning to the Original Lane** (Y = 0).  

### Assumptions:  
- Initial speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s).  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).  
- Obstruction is at (100, 0).  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).  
- Lane change duration: 2 seconds (smooth transition).  
- Time step: 1 second.  

### Calculations:  
1. **Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to 2 seconds)**  
   - At T = 0: Position = (0, 0).  
   - At T = 1: Position = (20, -2.5) (halfway through lane change).  
   - At T = 2: Position = (40, -5) (fully in the adjacent lane).  

2. **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to 6 seconds)**  
   - At T = 3: Position = (60, -5).  
   - At T = 4: Position = (80, -5).  
   - At T = 5: Position = (100, -5) (bypassing the obstruction).  
   - At T = 6: Position = (120, -5).  

3. **Phase 3: Returning to the Original Lane (T = 6 to 8 seconds)**  
   - At T = 7: Position = (140, -2.5) (halfway through lane change).  
   - At T = 8: Position = (160, 0) (fully in the original lane).  

4. **Continuing in the Original Lane (T = 8 to 10 seconds)**  
   - At T = 9: Position = (180, 0).  
   - At T = 10: Position = (200, 0).  

### Summary of Positions:  
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| 0        | (0, 0)          |  
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |  
| 2        | (40, -5)        |  
| 3        | (60, -5)        |  
| 4        | (80, -5)        |  
| 5        | (100, -5)       |  
| 6        | (120, -5)       |  
| 7        | (140, -2.5)     |  
| 8        | (160, 0)        |  
| 9        | (180, 0)        |  
| 10       | (200, 0)        |  

### Key Points:  
- The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout.  
- The lane changes are completed smoothly within 2 seconds each.  
- The obstruction is bypassed safely by staying in the adjacent lane from X = 40 to X = 120.  
- The vehicle returns to the original lane by T = 8 seconds and continues its journey.  

This plan ensures the vehicle navigates the obstruction safely while maintaining the required speed.
