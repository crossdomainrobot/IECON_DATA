To plan the vehicle's route around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we can break down the movement into critical intervals. Here's a step-by-step plan:

---

### **Assumptions and Initial Conditions**
1. **Starting Position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0).
2. **Obstruction Position**: (X, Y) = (100, 0).
3. **Adjacent Lane**: Y = -5.
4. **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h (20 m/s).
5. **Minimum Speed**: Must exceed 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).
6. **Time Intervals**: 1-second increments for 10 seconds.

---

### **Route Planning**
The vehicle needs to:
1. Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
2. Bypass the obstruction at X = 100.
3. Return to the original lane (Y = 0).

We¡¯ll assume smooth lane transitions and constant speed for simplicity.

### **Position Estimates at 1-Second Intervals**
1. **T = 0 s**: (X, Y) = (0, 0). Start in the outer lane.
2. **T = 1 s**: (X, Y) = (20, -1). Begin transitioning to the adjacent lane.
3. **T = 2 s**: (X, Y) = (40, -2). Continue lane transition.
4. **T = 3 s**: (X, Y) = (60, -3). Continue lane transition.
5. **T = 4 s**: (X, Y) = (80, -4). Continue lane transition.
6. **T = 5 s**: (X, Y) = (100, -5). Fully in the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction.
7. **T = 6 s**: (X, Y) = (120, -4). Begin transitioning back to the original lane.
8. **T = 7 s**: (X, Y) = (140, -3). Continue lane transition.
9. **T = 8 s**: (X, Y) = (160, -2). Continue lane transition.
10. **T = 9 s**: (X, Y) = (180, -1). Continue lane transition.
11. **T = 10 s**: (X, Y) = (200, 0). Fully back in the original lane.

---

### **Explanation**
1. **Lane Transition**: The vehicle moves laterally from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 5 seconds while maintaining a constant speed of 20 m/s along the X-axis.
2. **Bypassing Obstruction**: At T = 5 s, the vehicle is at (100, -5), safely bypassing the obstruction.
3. **Returning to Original Lane**: The vehicle transitions back from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over the next 5 seconds while continuing to move forward at 20 m/s.

### **Summary Table**
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -1    |
| 2        | 40    | -2    |
| 3        | 60    | -3    |
| 4        | 80    | -4    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -4    |
| 7        | 140   | -3    |
| 8        | 160   | -2    |
| 9        | 180   | -1    |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h while safely navigating around the obstruction.
