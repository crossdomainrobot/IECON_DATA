To plan the route, we'll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Returning to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**

### Given:
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s  
- Obstruction at (100, 0)  
- Adjacent lane at Y = -5  

### Assumptions:
- The lane change takes 2 seconds (smooth transition).  
- The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s during the maneuver.  

### Critical Intervals:
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at 1-second intervals over 10 seconds.

---

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2)**  
- **T = 0:** (0, 0)  
- **T = 1:** (20, -2.5) ¡ª Halfway through the lane change.  
- **T = 2:** (40, -5) ¡ª Fully in the adjacent lane.  

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)**  
- **T = 3:** (60, -5)  
- **T = 4:** (80, -5)  
- **T = 5:** (100, -5) ¡ª Reaches the obstruction¡¯s X-coordinate.  
- **T = 6:** (120, -5) ¡ª Fully bypassed the obstruction.  

#### **Phase 3: Returning to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)**  
- **T = 7:** (140, -2.5) ¡ª Halfway through the return.  
- **T = 8:** (160, 0) ¡ª Fully back in the original lane.  

#### **Phase 4: Continuing Straight (T = 8 to T = 10)**  
- **T = 9:** (180, 0)  
- **T = 10:** (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions (X, Y) at Critical Intervals:
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| T = 0    | (0, 0)          |  
| T = 1    | (20, -2.5)      |  
| T = 2    | (40, -5)        |  
| T = 3    | (60, -5)        |  
| T = 4    | (80, -5)        |  
| T = 5    | (100, -5)       |  
| T = 6    | (120, -5)       |  
| T = 7    | (140, -2.5)     |  
| T = 8    | (160, 0)        |  
| T = 9    | (180, 0)        |  
| T = 10   | (200, 0)        |  

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h, successfully navigates around the obstruction, and returns to the original lane.
