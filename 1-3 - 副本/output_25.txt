To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Returning to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**  

### Assumptions:
- Initial speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s)  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane)  
- Obstruction at X = 100 meters  
- Time intervals: 1-second steps  

### Phase 1: Lane Change (0 ¡Ü T ¡Ü 2 seconds)
We¡¯ll assume the lane change takes 2 seconds. During this time, the vehicle moves laterally from Y = 0 to Y = -5 while continuing forward at a constant speed of 20 m/s.

- **T = 0 s**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)  
- **T = 1 s**: (X, Y) = (20, -2.5)  
- **T = 2 s**: (X, Y) = (40, -5)  

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (2 < T ¡Ü 6 seconds)
The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) and continues forward at 20 m/s until it has passed the obstruction at X = 100.

- **T = 3 s**: (X, Y) = (60, -5)  
- **T = 4 s**: (X, Y) = (80, -5)  
- **T = 5 s**: (X, Y) = (100, -5)  
- **T = 6 s**: (X, Y) = (120, -5)  

### Phase 3: Returning to the Original Lane (6 < T ¡Ü 10 seconds)
The vehicle transitions back to the original lane (Y = 0) over 2 seconds while maintaining a speed of 20 m/s.

- **T = 7 s**: (X, Y) = (140, -2.5)  
- **T = 8 s**: (X, Y) = (160, 0)  
- **T = 9 s**: (X, Y) = (180, 0)  
- **T = 10 s**: (X, Y) = (200, 0)  

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |  
| 2        | 40    | -5    |  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    |  
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |  
| 8        | 160   | 0     |  
| 9        | 180   | 0     |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |  

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h throughout the maneuver and successfully navigates around the obstruction.
