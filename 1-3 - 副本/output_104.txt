To plan the route and estimate the vehicle's position at critical intervals, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**: Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction**: Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until the obstruction at X = 100 is bypassed.
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**: Transition from the adjacent lane (Y = -5) back to the outer lane (Y = 0).

### Assumptions:
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
- Speed must exceed 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s throughout the maneuver.
- Lane width: 5 meters (from Y = 0 to Y = -5).
- Lane change duration: 2 seconds (smooth transition).
- Total maneuver duration: 10 seconds.

### Step-by-Step Route Planning:

#### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)
- Time: T = 0 to T = 2 seconds.
- The vehicle moves laterally from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.
- Lateral velocity: \( \frac{-5 \, \text{m}}{2 \, \text{s}} = -2.5 \, \text{m/s} \).
- Longitudinal velocity: 20 m/s.

#### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (Y = -5)
- Time: T = 2 to T = 8 seconds.
- The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) and bypasses the obstruction at X = 100.
- Longitudinal velocity: 20 m/s.

#### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)
- Time: T = 8 to T = 10 seconds.
- The vehicle moves laterally from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.
- Lateral velocity: \( \frac{5 \, \text{m}}{2 \, \text{s}} = 2.5 \, \text{m/s} \).
- Longitudinal velocity: 20 m/s.

### Position Estimates at Critical Intervals:

| Time (T) | X (m)                        | Y (m)                        | Notes                                      |
|----------|------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 0        | 0                            | 0                            | Starting position                          |
| 1        | \( 20 \times 1 = 20 \)        | \( 0 + (-2.5 \times 1) = -2.5 \) | Transitioning to adjacent lane            |
| 2        | \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \)        | \( -2.5 + (-2.5 \times 1) = -5 \) | Fully in adjacent lane                    |
| 3        | \( 40 + 20 \times 1 = 60 \)   | -5                           | Bypassing obstruction                      |
| 4        | \( 60 + 20 \times 1 = 80 \)   | -5                           | Bypassing obstruction                      |
| 5        | \( 80 + 20 \times 1 = 100 \)  | -5                           | Obstruction bypassed                       |
| 6        | \( 100 + 20 \times 1 = 120 \) | -5                           | Continuing in adjacent lane                |
| 7        | \( 120 + 20 \times 1 = 140 \) | -5                           | Continuing in adjacent lane                |
| 8        | \( 140 + 20 \times 1 = 160 \) | \( -5 + 2.5 \times 1 = -2.5 \) | Transitioning back to original lane       |
| 9        | \( 160 + 20 \times 1 = 180 \) | \( -2.5 + 2.5 \times 1 = 0 \) | Fully back in original lane               |
| 10       | \( 180 + 20 \times 1 = 200 \) | 0                            | Maneuver complete                          |

### Key Points:
- The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver, satisfying the speed constraint.
- The obstruction at X = 100 is bypassed while the vehicle is in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
- The lane changes are completed smoothly within 2 seconds each.
