To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction**
3. **Returning to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**

### Given:
- **Initial Position:** (0, 0)
- **Obstruction Position:** (100, 0)
- **Adjacent Lane Y-Coordinate:** -5
- **Initial Speed:** 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum Speed:** 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- **Time Interval:** 10 seconds

### Assumptions:
- The lane change takes **2 seconds** (smooth transition).
- The bypass phase lasts until the vehicle is **clear of the obstruction**.
- The return to the original lane also takes **2 seconds**.

---

### Step 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2)
During the first 2 seconds, the vehicle transitions from Y = 0 to Y = -5.

- **X-Position:** The vehicle continues moving forward at 20 m/s.
  - At T = 1, X = 20 m
  - At T = 2, X = 40 m
- **Y-Position:** The vehicle moves laterally to Y = -5.
  - At T = 1, Y = -2.5 m (halfway)
  - At T = 2, Y = -5 m

**Positions:**
- T = 1: (20, -2.5)
- T = 2: (40, -5)

---

### Step 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)
The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while bypassing the obstruction at X = 100.

- **X-Position:** The vehicle continues at 20 m/s.
  - At T = 3, X = 60 m
  - At T = 4, X = 80 m
  - At T = 5, X = 100 m
  - At T = 6, X = 120 m

**Positions:**
- T = 3: (60, -5)
- T = 4: (80, -5)
- T = 5: (100, -5)
- T = 6: (120, -5)

---

### Step 3: Returning to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)
The vehicle transitions back to the original lane (Y = 0) over 2 seconds.

- **X-Position:** The vehicle continues at 20 m/s.
  - At T = 7, X = 140 m
  - At T = 8, X = 160 m
- **Y-Position:** The vehicle moves laterally to Y = 0.
  - At T = 7, Y = -2.5 m (halfway)
  - At T = 8, Y = 0 m

**Positions:**
- T = 7: (140, -2.5)
- T = 8: (160, 0)

---

### Step 4: Continuing in the Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)
The vehicle continues in the original lane (Y = 0) at 20 m/s.

- **X-Position:**
  - At T = 9, X = 180 m
  - At T = 10, X = 200 m

**Positions:**
- T = 9: (180, 0)
- T = 10: (200, 0)

---

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)           |
| 1        | (20, -2.5)       |
| 2        | (40, -5)         |
| 3        | (60, -5)         |
| 4        | (80, -5)         |
| 5        | (100, -5)        |
| 6        | (120, -5)        |
| 7        | (140, -2.5)      |
| 8        | (160, 0)         |
| 9        | (180, 0)         |
| 10       | (200, 0)         |

This plan ensures the vehicle safely navigates around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
