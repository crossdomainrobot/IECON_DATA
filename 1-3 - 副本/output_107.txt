To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we'll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**

### Given:
- Initial position: (0, 0)  
- Obstruction position: (100, 0)  
- Adjacent lane¡¯s Y-coordinate: Y = -5  
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h (20 m/s)  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)  
- Time interval: 10 seconds  

### Assumptions:
- Lane changes take 2 seconds each.  
- Speed remains constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h) during the maneuver.  
- The obstruction is bypassed completely by X = 100.

### Step-by-Step Plan:

#### Phase 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)
- **Time:** T = 0 to T = 2 seconds  
- **Lateral Movement:** Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.  
- **Longitudinal Movement:** X increases at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m)   |
|----------|-------|---------|
| 0        | 0     | 0       |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5    |
| 2        | 40    | -5      |

#### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)
- **Time:** T = 2 to T = 6 seconds  
- **Lateral Position:** Y = -5 (stay in the adjacent lane).  
- **Longitudinal Movement:** X increases at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |

#### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to Original Lane (Y = 0)
- **Time:** T = 6 to T = 8 seconds  
- **Lateral Movement:** Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.  
- **Longitudinal Movement:** X increases at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m)   |
|----------|-------|---------|
| 7        | 140   | -2.5    |
| 8        | 160   | 0       |

#### Phase 4: Continue in Original Lane
- **Time:** T = 8 to T = 10 seconds  
- **Lateral Position:** Y = 0 (stay in the original lane).  
- **Longitudinal Movement:** X increases at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 9        | 180   | 0     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m)   |
|----------|-------|---------|
| 0        | 0     | 0       |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5    |
| 2        | 40    | -5      |
| 3        | 60    | -5      |
| 4        | 80    | -5      |
| 5        | 100   | -5      |
| 6        | 120   | -5      |
| 7        | 140   | -2.5    |
| 8        | 160   | 0       |
| 9        | 180   | 0       |
| 10       | 200   | 0       |

This plan ensures the obstruction is bypassed while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h and completing the lane changes smoothly.
