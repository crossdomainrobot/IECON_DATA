To navigate around the obstruction, we¡¯ll plan a smooth trajectory that ensures the vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane, bypasses the obstruction, and returns to the original lane while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h. Here¡¯s the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Key Assumptions:**
1. **Initial Position:** (X, Y) = (0, 0) at T = 0.
2. **Obstruction Position:** (X, Y) = (100, 0).
3. **Adjacent Lane:** Y = -5.
4. **Initial Speed:** 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
5. **Minimum Speed:** 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.
6. **Time Frame:** 10 seconds.

---

### **Route Planning:**
1. **Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2.5 seconds):**
   - Move from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2.5 seconds.
   - X-coordinate increases linearly at 20 m/s.

2. **Bypassing Obstruction (T = 2.5 to T = 7.5 seconds):**
   - Maintain Y = -5 while traveling past the obstruction (X = 100).
   - X-coordinate increases linearly at 20 m/s.

3. **Return to Original Lane (T = 7.5 to T = 10 seconds):**
   - Move from Y = -5 back to Y = 0 over 2.5 seconds.
   - X-coordinate increases linearly at 20 m/s.

### **Position Estimates:**
| Time (s) | X (m)           | Y (m)           |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 0        | 0               | 0               |
| 1        | 20              | -2              |
| 2        | 40              | -4              |
| 2.5      | 50              | -5              |
| 3        | 60              | -5              |
| 4        | 80              | -5              |
| 5        | 100             | -5              |
| 6        | 120             | -5              |
| 7        | 140             | -5              |
| 7.5      | 150             | -5              |
| 8        | 160             | -4              |
| 9        | 180             | -2              |
| 10       | 200             | 0               |

### **Explanation:**
1. **Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2.5 seconds):**
   - The vehicle moves laterally from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2.5 seconds.
   - X increases at 20 m/s: X = 20 * T.

2. **Bypassing Obstruction (T = 2.5 to T = 7.5 seconds):**
   - The vehicle maintains Y = -5 while traveling past the obstruction.
   - X increases at 20 m/s: X = 50 + 20 * (T - 2.5).

3. **Return to Original Lane (T = 7.5 to T = 10 seconds):**
   - The vehicle moves laterally from Y = -5 back to Y = 0 over 2.5 seconds.
   - X increases at 20 m/s: X = 150 + 20 * (T - 7.5).

### **Speed Check:**
- The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h), which exceeds the minimum requirement of 16.67 m/s (60 km/h).

This plan ensures a smooth and safe maneuver around the obstruction.
