To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Transition to the adjacent lane (from Y = 0 to Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypass the obstruction (travel past X = 100 while maintaining Y = -5)**  
3. **Return to the original lane (from Y = -5 to Y = 0)**

### Assumptions:
- **Initial velocity**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s  
- **Minimum speed**: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s  
- **Obstruction location**: X = 100 m, Y = 0  
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5  
- **Time step**: 1 second intervals  

### Phase 1: Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = 0 to Y = -5)
Assume the lane change takes **2 seconds**, during which the vehicle moves laterally while maintaining forward speed.

- At T = 0: (X, Y) = (0, 0)  
- At T = 1: (X, Y) = (20, -2.5)  
- At T = 2: (X, Y) = (40, -5)  

### Phase 2: Bypass the obstruction (X = 100, Y = -5)
The vehicle continues forward at 20 m/s, staying in the adjacent lane.

- At T = 3: (X, Y) = (60, -5)  
- At T = 4: (X, Y) = (80, -5)  
- At T = 5: (X, Y) = (100, -5)  
- At T = 6: (X, Y) = (120, -5)  

### Phase 3: Return to the original lane (Y = -5 to Y = 0)
Assume the lane change takes **2 seconds**, similar to Phase 1.

- At T = 7: (X, Y) = (140, -2.5)  
- At T = 8: (X, Y) = (160, 0)  

### Final Positions:
- At T = 9: (X, Y) = (180, 0)  
- At T = 10: (X, Y) = (200, 0)  

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |
| 2        | 40    | -5    |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |
| 8        | 160   | 0     |
| 9        | 180   | 0     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
