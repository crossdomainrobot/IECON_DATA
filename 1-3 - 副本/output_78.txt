To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Transition Phase**: Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
2. **Bypass Phase**: Continue traveling in the adjacent lane until the obstruction (X = 100) is bypassed.
3. **Return Phase**: Transition back to the original lane (Y = 0).

### Assumptions:
- Vehicle speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s).
- Maintain speed > 60 km/h (16.67 m/s) at all times.
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).
- Obstruction is at X = 100 meters.
- Smooth lane transitions take approximately 2 seconds each.

### Route Plan:
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at 1-second intervals.

#### **Phase 1: Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2)**
- **Objective**: Move from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.
- **Lateral movement**: Y decreases linearly from 0 to -5 in 2 seconds.
- **Longitudinal movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (T) | X (m)        | Y (m)        |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| 0        | 0            | 0            |
| 1        | 20           | -2.5         |
| 2        | 40           | -5           |

---

#### **Phase 2: Bypass (T = 2 to T = 6)**
- **Objective**: Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until X > 100.
- **Longitudinal movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.

At T = 2, X = 40 m. The obstruction is at X = 100 m, so the vehicle needs to travel an additional 60 m to bypass it.

| Time (T) | X (m)        | Y (m)        |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| 3        | 60           | -5           |
| 4        | 80           | -5           |
| 5        | 100          | -5           |
| 6        | 120          | -5           |

---

#### **Phase 3: Return (T = 6 to T = 8)**
- **Objective**: Move from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.
- **Lateral movement**: Y increases linearly from -5 to 0 in 2 seconds.
- **Longitudinal movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (T) | X (m)        | Y (m)        |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| 7        | 140          | -2.5         |
| 8        | 160          | 0            |

#### **Summary of Positions (T = 0 to T = 8):**

| Time (T) | X (m)        | Y (m)        |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| 0        | 0            | 0            |
| 1        | 20           | -2.5         |
| 2        | 40           | -5           |
| 3        | 60           | -5           |
| 4        | 80           | -5           |
| 5        | 100          | -5           |
| 6        | 120          | -5           |
| 7        | 140          | -2.5         |
| 8        | 160          | 0            |

### Key Points:
- The lane transitions are completed within 2 seconds each.
- The obstruction is bypassed by T = 6 (X = 120 m).
- The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h), exceeding the minimum requirement of 16.67 m/s (60 km/h).
- The maneuver is completed by T = 8 seconds.
