To plan your route around the obstruction, we'll break down the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane**: Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction**: Maintain the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstruction at X = 100.
3. **Return to the Original Lane**: Transition back from the adjacent lane (Y = -5) to the outer lane (Y = 0).

### Assumptions:
- **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
- **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.
- **Lane Change Duration**: Assume 2 seconds for each lane change.
- **Obstruction Position**: (100, 0).
- **Time Step**: 1 second.

### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2)
- **Lateral Movement**: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Continue moving forward at 20 m/s.

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 5)
- **Lateral Position**: Maintain Y = -5.
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Continue moving forward at 20 m/s.

### Phase 3: Return to the Original Lane (T = 5 to T = 7)
- **Lateral Movement**: Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Continue moving forward at 20 m/s.

### Position Estimates:
- **T = 0**: (0, 0)
- **T = 1**: (20, -2.5)  // Halfway through the lane change
- **T = 2**: (40, -5)    // Fully in the adjacent lane
- **T = 3**: (60, -5)
- **T = 4**: (80, -5)
- **T = 5**: (100, -5)   // Obstruction bypassed
- **T = 6**: (120, -2.5) // Halfway back to the original lane
- **T = 7**: (140, 0)    // Fully back in the outer lane
- **T = 8**: (160, 0)
- **T = 9**: (180, 0)
- **T = 10**: (200, 0)

### Summary:
- **Lane Change**: Completed by T = 2.
- **Obstruction Bypassed**: At T = 5.
- **Return to Original Lane**: Completed by T = 7.

This plan ensures you maintain a speed above 60 km/h while safely navigating around the obstruction.
