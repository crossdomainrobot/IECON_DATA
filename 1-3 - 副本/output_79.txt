To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break this into three phases:

1. **Transition to the adjacent lane**: Move from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
2. **Bypass the obstruction**: Continue traveling in the adjacent lane until you¡¯ve passed the obstruction (X = 100).
3. **Return to the original lane**: Move back to the outer lane (Y = 0).

We¡¯ll assume the vehicle maintains a constant speed of **72 km/h (20 m/s)** throughout the maneuver. The lateral movement (changing lanes) will be completed smoothly over a short period.

### Assumptions:
- **Lateral movement**: Changing lanes takes **2 seconds** (from T = 0 to T = 2 for the first lane change, and T = 6 to T = 8 for the return).
- **Bypassing the obstruction**: The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) from T = 2 to T = 6.
- **Critical intervals**: Positions are calculated every second.

### Route Plan:

#### Phase 1: Transition to the adjacent lane (T = 0 to T = 2)
- **Lateral movement**: Y changes linearly from 0 to -5 over 2 seconds.
- **Longitudinal movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| T = 0    | 0     | 0     |
| T = 1    | 20    | -2.5  |
| T = 2    | 40    | -5    |

#### Phase 2: Bypass the obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)
- **Lateral position**: Y remains at -5.
- **Longitudinal movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| T = 3    | 60    | -5    |
| T = 4    | 80    | -5    |
| T = 5    | 100   | -5    |
| T = 6    | 120   | -5    |

#### Phase 3: Return to the original lane (T = 6 to T = 8)
- **Lateral movement**: Y changes linearly from -5 to 0 over 2 seconds.
- **Longitudinal movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| T = 7    | 140   | -2.5  |
| T = 8    | 160   | 0     |

#### Phase 4: Continue in the original lane (T = 8 to T = 10)
- **Lateral position**: Y remains at 0.
- **Longitudinal movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| T = 9    | 180   | 0     |
| T = 10   | 200   | 0     |

### Summary of Positions:

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| T = 0    | 0     | 0     |
| T = 1    | 20    | -2.5  |
| T = 2    | 40    | -5    |
| T = 3    | 60    | -5    |
| T = 4    | 80    | -5    |
| T = 5    | 100   | -5    |
| T = 6    | 120   | -5    |
| T = 7    | 140   | -2.5  |
| T = 8    | 160   | 0     |
| T = 9    | 180   | 0     |
| T = 10   | 200   | 0     |

### Key Points:
- The vehicle bypasses the obstruction (X = 100) at T = 5, while in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
- The lane changes are completed smoothly within 2 seconds each.
- The speed remains constant at 72 km/h (20 m/s) throughout the maneuver.
