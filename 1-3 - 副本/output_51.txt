To plan the route, we'll break down the vehicle's movement into segments: accelerating, lane changing, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. We'll use the following assumptions:

1. **Initial velocity**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
2. **Minimum speed**: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.
3. **Lane width**: The adjacent lane is at Y = -5 (5 meters to the left of the original lane).
4. **Obstruction**: Located at (100, 0).

We'll calculate the vehicle's position at 1-second intervals for 10 seconds.

### Step 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)
- **Time**: 3 seconds.
- **Action**: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
- **Lateral speed**: Assume a smooth lateral movement of 1.67 m/s (5 meters in 3 seconds).
- **Forward speed**: Maintain 20 m/s.

Positions:
- **T = 1**: X = 20 m, Y = -1.67 m.
- **T = 2**: X = 40 m, Y = -3.33 m.
- **T = 3**: X = 60 m, Y = -5 m.

---

### Step 2: Bypass Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7 seconds)
- **Time**: 4 seconds.
- **Action**: Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while bypassing the obstruction at X = 100.
- **Forward speed**: Maintain 20 m/s.

Positions:
- **T = 4**: X = 80 m, Y = -5 m.
- **T = 5**: X = 100 m, Y = -5 m.
- **T = 6**: X = 120 m, Y = -5 m.
- **T = 7**: X = 140 m, Y = -5 m.

---

### Step 3: Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds)
- **Time**: 3 seconds.
- **Action**: Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0.
- **Lateral speed**: Assume a smooth lateral movement of 1.67 m/s (5 meters in 3 seconds).
- **Forward speed**: Maintain 20 m/s.

Positions:
- **T = 8**: X = 160 m, Y = -3.33 m.
- **T = 9**: X = 180 m, Y = -1.67 m.
- **T = 10**: X = 200 m, Y = 0 m.

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -1.67 |
| 2        | 40    | -3.33 |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -5    |
| 8        | 160   | -3.33 |
| 9        | 180   | -1.67 |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

This plan ensures the obstruction is bypassed while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
