To plan the route, we¡¯ll break down the vehicle¡¯s movement into phases:  
1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane** (Y = -5).  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction** while staying in the adjacent lane.  
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane** (Y = 0).  

### Given:  
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.  
- Speed must exceed 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s at all times.  
- Time interval: 10 seconds.  
- Obstruction at (100, 0).  
- Adjacent lane at Y = -5.  

### Assumptions:  
- Lane changes take 2 seconds each (a smooth transition).  
- Speed remains constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h).  
- The vehicle travels in a straight line except during lane changes.  

### Route Plan:  

#### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)  
- **Time**: T = 0 to T = 2 seconds.  
- **Movement**: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5.  
- **X-position**: Increases linearly at 20 m/s.  

Positions:  
- T = 0: (0, 0)  
- T = 1: (20, -2.5)  
- T = 2: (40, -5)  

#### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction  
- **Time**: T = 2 to T = 6 seconds.  
- **Movement**: Travel in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) past the obstruction at X = 100.  
- **X-position**: Increases linearly at 20 m/s.  

Positions:  
- T = 3: (60, -5)  
- T = 4: (80, -5)  
- T = 5: (100, -5)  
- T = 6: (120, -5)  

#### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)  
- **Time**: T = 6 to T = 8 seconds.  
- **Movement**: Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0.  
- **X-position**: Increases linearly at 20 m/s.  

Positions:  
- T = 7: (140, -2.5)  
- T = 8: (160, 0)  

#### Phase 4: Continue in the Original Lane  
- **Time**: T = 8 to T = 10 seconds.  
- **Movement**: Travel in the original lane (Y = 0).  
- **X-position**: Increases linearly at 20 m/s.  

Positions:  
- T = 9: (180, 0)  
- T = 10: (200, 0)  

### Summary of Positions:  
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |  
| 2        | 40    | -5    |  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    |  
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |  
| 8        | 160   | 0     |  
| 9        | 180   | 0     |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |  

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h and completes the maneuver within 10 seconds.
