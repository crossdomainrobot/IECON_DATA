To plan the route for bypassing the obstruction, we¡¯ll break it into three phases:

1. **Phase 1: Transition to the adjacent lane** (from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \))  
2. **Phase 2: Bypass the obstruction** (travel in the adjacent lane past \( X = 100 \))  
3. **Phase 3: Return to the original lane** (from \( Y = -5 \) to \( Y = 0 \))  

### Assumptions:
- **Initial velocity**: 72 km/h (20 m/s, since 72 km/h = 72 ¡Á 1000 / 3600 = 20 m/s).  
- **Minimum speed**: Must exceed 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).  
- **Obstruction location**: \( (100, 0) \).  
- **Adjacent lane**: \( Y = -5 \).  
- **Time step**: 1 second.  

### Constraints:
- The vehicle must bypass the obstruction in the adjacent lane (\( Y = -5 \)) at \( X = 100 \).  
- Speed must remain above 16.67 m/s.  

### Route Planning:
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position \( (X, Y) \) at each second from \( T = 0 \) to \( T = 10 \).  

#### Phase 1: Transition to the adjacent lane (\( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \))  
Assume this takes 2 seconds, with linear lateral movement:  
- \( T = 0 \): \( (0, 0) \)  
- \( T = 1 \): \( (20, -2.5) \) (halfway to the adjacent lane)  
- \( T = 2 \): \( (40, -5) \) (fully in the adjacent lane)  

#### Phase 2: Bypass the obstruction (\( Y = -5 \))  
Maintain the adjacent lane while passing the obstruction at \( X = 100 \):  
- \( T = 3 \): \( (60, -5) \)  
- \( T = 4 \): \( (80, -5) \)  
- \( T = 5 \): \( (100, -5) \) (bypass the obstruction)  

#### Phase 3: Return to the original lane (\( Y = -5 \) to \( Y = 0 \))  
Assume this takes 2 seconds, with linear lateral movement:  
- \( T = 6 \): \( (120, -2.5) \) (halfway back to the original lane)  
- \( T = 7 \): \( (140, 0) \) (fully in the original lane)  

#### Continue traveling in the original lane:  
- \( T = 8 \): \( (160, 0) \)  
- \( T = 9 \): \( (180, 0) \)  
- \( T = 10 \): \( (200, 0) \)  

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | Position \( (X, Y) \) |  
|----------|-----------------------|  
| 0        | \( (0, 0) \)          |  
| 1        | \( (20, -2.5) \)      |  
| 2        | \( (40, -5) \)        |  
| 3        | \( (60, -5) \)        |  
| 4        | \( (80, -5) \)        |  
| 5        | \( (100, -5) \)       |  
| 6        | \( (120, -2.5) \)     |  
| 7        | \( (140, 0) \)        |  
| 8        | \( (160, 0) \)        |  
| 9        | \( (180, 0) \)        |  
| 10       | \( (200, 0) \)        |  

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
