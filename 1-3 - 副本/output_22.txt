To plan the route, we need to consider the vehicle's speed, the distance to the obstacle, and the time required to change lanes and bypass the obstruction. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

---

### **Given:**
- **Initial position:** \( (X, Y) = (0, 0) \)
- **Obstruction position:** \( (100, 0) \)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate:** \( Y = -5 \)
- **Initial speed:** \( 72 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \)
- **Minimum speed:** \( > 60 \, \text{km/h} \approx 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \)

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The lane change takes **3 seconds** (smooth transition).
2. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).
3. The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane until it has fully bypassed the obstruction at \( X = 100 \).

---

### **Route Planning:**

#### **1. Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 3):**
- **T = 0:** \( (0, 0) \)
- **T = 1:** \( (20, -1.67) \)
- **T = 2:** \( (40, -3.33) \)
- **T = 3:** \( (60, -5) \)

#### **2. Bypassing Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 5):**
- **T = 4:** \( (80, -5) \)
- **T = 5:** \( (100, -5) \)

#### **3. Lane Change Back (T = 5 to T = 8):**
- **T = 6:** \( (120, -3.33) \)
- **T = 7:** \( (140, -1.67) \)
- **T = 8:** \( (160, 0) \)

#### **4. Continuing in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10):**
- **T = 9:** \( (180, 0) \)
- **T = 10:** \( (200, 0) \)

### **Summary of Positions:**

| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -1.67)     |
| 2        | (40, -3.33)     |
| 3        | (60, -5)        |
| 4        | (80, -5)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -3.33)    |
| 7        | (140, -1.67)    |
| 8        | (160, 0)        |
| 9        | (180, 0)        |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

### **Explanation:**
1. **Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 3):** The vehicle transitions smoothly from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \) over 3 seconds while moving forward at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).
2. **Bypassing Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 5):** The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane until it has passed the obstruction at \( X = 100 \).
3. **Lane Change Back (T = 5 to T = 8):** The vehicle transitions back to the original lane over 3 seconds.
4. **Continuing in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10):** The vehicle continues traveling in the original lane.

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above \( 60 \, \text{km/h} \) throughout the maneuver.
