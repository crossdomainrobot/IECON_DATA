To navigate around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll plan the vehicle¡¯s trajectory in 1-second intervals. Here¡¯s the step-by-step route planning:

---

### **Assumptions and Calculations**
1. **Initial Speed**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
2. **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.
3. **Lane Transition**: The adjacent lane is at \( Y = -5 \).
4. **Obstruction**: Located at \( (100, 0) \).
5. **Time Intervals**: 1 second each, from \( T = 0 \) to \( T = 10 \).

---

### **Route Plan**
We¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:
1. **Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**.
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**.
3. **Return to Original Lane (Y = 0)**.

---

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 3)**
- At \( T = 0 \): \( (0, 0) \).
- At \( T = 1 \): Move to \( (20, -1.67) \).
- At \( T = 2 \): Move to \( (40, -3.33) \).
- At \( T = 3 \): Move to \( (60, -5) \).

---

#### **Phase 2: Bypass Obstruction (T = 4 to T = 6)**
- At \( T = 4 \): Move to \( (80, -5) \).
- At \( T = 5 \): Move to \( (100, -5) \).
- At \( T = 6 \): Move to \( (120, -5) \).

---

#### **Phase 3: Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10)**
- At \( T = 7 \): Move to \( (140, -3.33) \).
- At \( T = 8 \): Move to \( (160, -1.67) \).
- At \( T = 9 \): Move to \( (180, 0) \).
- At \( T = 10 \): Move to \( (200, 0) \).

### **Summary of Positions**
| Time (T) | Position (X, Y)     |
|----------|---------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)             |
| 1        | (20, -1.67)        |
| 2        | (40, -3.33)        |
| 3        | (60, -5)           |
| 4        | (80, -5)           |
| 5        | (100, -5)          |
| 6        | (120, -5)          |
| 7        | (140, -3.33)       |
| 8        | (160, -1.67)       |
| 9        | (180, 0)           |
| 10       | (200, 0)           |

### **Key Points**
- The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout.
- The lane change is smooth and completed within 3 seconds.
- The obstruction is bypassed safely at \( X = 100 \), while the vehicle is in the adjacent lane.
- The vehicle returns to its original lane by \( T = 10 \).
