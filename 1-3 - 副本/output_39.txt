To construct a route planning for your vehicle, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Transition (from Y = 0 to Y = -5):**  
   You need to move from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) before reaching the obstruction at X = 100.  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction:**  
   You¡¯ll stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstruction at X = 100.  
3. **Return to Original Lane (from Y = -5 to Y = 0):**  
   After bypassing the obstruction, you¡¯ll transition back to the outer lane (Y = 0).  

We¡¯ll assume smooth lane transitions and constant speed throughout. Your initial speed is 72 km/h, which is equivalent to 20 m/s (since 72 km/h = 20 m/s).

### Route Planning:  
We¡¯ll outline your vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at 1-second intervals over the next 10 seconds.  

#### Phase 1: Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)  
- At T = 0: (X, Y) = (0, 0)  
- At T = 1: (X, Y) = (20, -2.5)  
- At T = 2: (X, Y) = (40, -5)  

#### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6 seconds)  
- At T = 3: (X, Y) = (60, -5)  
- At T = 4: (X, Y) = (80, -5)  
- At T = 5: (X, Y) = (100, -5)  
- At T = 6: (X, Y) = (120, -5)  

#### Phase 3: Return to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)  
- At T = 7: (X, Y) = (140, -2.5)  
- At T = 8: (X, Y) = (160, 0)  

#### Phase 4: Continuing in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds)  
- At T = 9: (X, Y) = (180, 0)  
- At T = 10: (X, Y) = (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions:  
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |  
| 2        | 40    | -5    |  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    |  
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |  
| 8        | 160   | 0     |  
| 9        | 180   | 0     |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### Notes:  
- The lane transitions are assumed to be smooth and linear over 2 seconds each.  
- Your speed remains constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h), ensuring it stays above the required 60 km/h.  
- The obstruction is bypassed between T = 5 and T = 6 seconds.  
- After T = 8 seconds, you¡¯re back in the original lane and continue driving straight.
