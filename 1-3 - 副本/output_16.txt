To construct a route planning for your vehicle, we'll break down the movement into three phases: **lane transition**, **bypassing the obstruction**, and **returning to the original lane**. We'll calculate your vehicle's position (X, Y) at 1-second intervals (T = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10) while ensuring the speed remains above 60 km/h.

### **Given:**
- Starting position: (0, 0)
- Obstruction position: (100, 0)
- Adjacent lane Y-coordinate: Y = -5
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- Time interval: 1 second

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. **Lane transition**: Smooth lateral movement over 2 seconds to transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
2. **Bypassing the obstruction**: Travel in the adjacent lane until the obstruction is passed (X > 100).
3. **Returning to the original lane**: Smooth lateral movement over 2 seconds to transition back to the original lane (Y = 0).
4. **Speed**: Maintain a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout.

### **Route Planning:**

#### **Phase 1: Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2)**
- **Lateral movement**: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.
  - Y changes linearly: Y = -2.5 * T
- **Longitudinal movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.
  - X = 20 * T

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |
| 2        | 40    | -5    |

---

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)**
- **Lateral movement**: Remain in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
- **Longitudinal movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.
  - X = 40 + 20 * (T - 2)

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |

---

#### **Phase 3: Returning to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)**
- **Lateral movement**: Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.
  - Y changes linearly: Y = -5 + 2.5 * (T - 6)
- **Longitudinal movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.
  - X = 120 + 20 * (T - 6)

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |
| 8        | 160   | 0     |

---

#### **Phase 4: Continuing in the Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)**
- **Lateral movement**: Remain in the original lane (Y = 0).
- **Longitudinal movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.
  - X = 160 + 20 * (T - 8)

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 9        | 180   | 0     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### **Summary of Positions:**

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) | Phase                          |
|----------|-------|-------|--------------------------------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     | Lane transition                |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  | Lane transition                |
| 2        | 40    | -5    | Bypassing the obstruction      |
| 3        | 60    | -5    | Bypassing the obstruction      |
| 4        | 80    | -5    | Bypassing the obstruction      |
| 5        | 100   | -5    | Bypassing the obstruction      |
| 6        | 120   | -5    | Returning to the original lane |
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  | Returning to the original lane |
| 8        | 160   | 0     | Continuing in the original lane |
| 9        | 180   | 0     | Continuing in the original lane |
| 10       | 200   | 0     | Continuing in the original lane |

### **Key Observations:**
1. The obstruction is bypassed between T = 5 and T = 6 (X = 100 to X = 120).
2. The vehicle returns to the original lane by T = 8.
3. The speed is maintained at 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout, satisfying the minimum speed requirement.
