To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Returning to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**  

### Assumptions:
- **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s  
- **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s  
- **Obstruction Position**: (100, 0)  
- **Adjacent Lane Position**: Y = -5  
- **Time Interval**: 1 second  

### Route Plan:
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at 1-second intervals over the next 10 seconds.  

#### Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 3)  
- The vehicle moves from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds.  
- Lateral velocity: \( \frac{-5}{3} \approx -1.67 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- Forward velocity: 20 m/s (constant)  

| Time (s) | X (m)        | Y (m)        |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| T = 0    | 0            | 0            |
| T = 1    | 20           | -1.67        |
| T = 2    | 40           | -3.33        |
| T = 3    | 60           | -5           |

#### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 6)  
- The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while bypassing the obstruction at X = 100.  
- Forward velocity: 20 m/s (constant)  

| Time (s) | X (m)        | Y (m)        |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| T = 4    | 80           | -5           |
| T = 5    | 100          | -5           |
| T = 6    | 120          | -5           |

#### Phase 3: Returning to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 9)  
- The vehicle moves from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.  
- Lateral velocity: \( \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- Forward velocity: 20 m/s (constant)  

| Time (s) | X (m)        | Y (m)        |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| T = 7    | 140          | -3.33        |
| T = 8    | 160          | -1.67        |
| T = 9    | 180          | 0            |

#### Final Position (T = 10)  
- The vehicle continues in the original lane (Y = 0) at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m)        | Y (m)        |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| T = 10   | 200          | 0            |

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m)  |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 0        | 0     | 0      |
| 1        | 20    | -1.67  |
| 2        | 40    | -3.33  |
| 3        | 60    | -5     |
| 4        | 80    | -5     |
| 5        | 100   | -5     |
| 6        | 120   | -5     |
| 7        | 140   | -3.33  |
| 8        | 160   | -1.67  |
| 9        | 180   | 0      |
| 10       | 200   | 0      |

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h while safely navigating around the obstruction.
