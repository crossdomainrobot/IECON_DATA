To construct a route planning for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed exceeding 60 km/h, we need to consider the following:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - Starting position: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
   - Obstruction position: (100, 0)
   - Adjacent lane Y-coordinate: Y = -5
   - Initial velocity: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
   - Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)

2. **Assumptions:**
   - The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) throughout the maneuver.
   - The lane change is smooth and takes a certain amount of time. For simplicity, let's assume the lane change takes 2 seconds.

3. **Route Planning:**
   - **T = 0 s:** (0, 0)
   - **T = 1 s:** (20, 0) 
   - **T = 2 s:** (40, 0) 
   - **T = 3 s:** (60, -1.25) 
   - **T = 4 s:** (80, -2.5) 
   - **T = 5 s:** (100, -5) 
   - **T = 6 s:** (120, -5) 
   - **T = 7 s:** (140, -3.75) 
   - **T = 8 s:** (160, -2.5) 
   - **T = 9 s:** (180, -1.25) 
   - **T = 10 s:** (200, 0) 

4. **Explanation:**
   - **T = 0 s to T = 2 s:** The vehicle continues in the outer lane, covering 40 meters.
   - **T = 3 s to T = 5 s:** The vehicle begins transitioning to the adjacent lane, reaching the adjacent lane (Y = -5) by T = 5 s.
   - **T = 6 s:** The vehicle continues in the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction at X = 100.
   - **T = 7 s to T = 10 s:** The vehicle transitions back to the original lane, completing the maneuver by T = 10 s.

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h throughout the maneuver.
