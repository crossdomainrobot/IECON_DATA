To plan the route, we'll break down the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5)**.
2. **Bypass the obstruction at X = 100**.
3. **Return to the original lane (Y = 0)**.

### Assumptions:
- **Initial velocity**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
- **Minimum speed**: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.
- **Time interval**: 1 second.
- **Obstruction position**: (100, 0).
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5.

### Phase 1: Transition to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)
We assume the lane change takes 2 seconds. During this time, the vehicle moves laterally from Y = 0 to Y = -5 while continuing to move forward at 20 m/s.

#### Positions:
- **T = 0 s**: (0, 0).
- **T = 1 s**: (20, -2.5).
- **T = 2 s**: (40, -5).

### Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction (X = 100)
After transitioning to the adjacent lane, the vehicle continues moving forward at 20 m/s until it bypasses the obstruction at X = 100.

#### Positions:
- **T = 3 s**: (60, -5).
- **T = 4 s**: (80, -5).
- **T = 5 s**: (100, -5).

### Phase 3: Return to the Original Lane (Y = 0)
We assume the return lane change also takes 2 seconds. During this time, the vehicle moves laterally from Y = -5 to Y = 0 while continuing to move forward at 20 m/s.

#### Positions:
- **T = 6 s**: (120, -2.5).
- **T = 7 s**: (140, 0).

### Final Positions (T = 8 s, 9 s, 10 s)
After completing the lane change, the vehicle continues moving forward at 20 m/s in the original lane.

#### Positions:
- **T = 8 s**: (160, 0).
- **T = 9 s**: (180, 0).
- **T = 10 s**: (200, 0).

### Summary of Positions:
- **T = 0 s**: (0, 0).
- **T = 1 s**: (20, -2.5).
- **T = 2 s**: (40, -5).
- **T = 3 s**: (60, -5).
- **T = 4 s**: (80, -5).
- **T = 5 s**: (100, -5).
- **T = 6 s**: (120, -2.5).
- **T = 7 s**: (140, 0).
- **T = 8 s**: (160, 0).
- **T = 9 s**: (180, 0).
- **T = 10 s**: (200, 0).

This route ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
