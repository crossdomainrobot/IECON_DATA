To construct a route planning for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane**: Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction**: Maintain the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstruction at X = 100.
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane**: Transition back from the adjacent lane (Y = -5) to the outer lane (Y = 0).

### Assumptions:
- **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h (20 m/s).
- **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).
- **Lane Change Duration**: Assume each lane change takes 3 seconds.
- **Straight-line Motion**: Maintain constant speed while changing lanes.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

#### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 3)
- **X-Position**: \( X(T) = 20T \) (constant speed of 20 m/s).
- **Y-Position**: \( Y(T) = -\frac{5}{3}T \) (linear transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds).

#### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7)
- **X-Position**: \( X(T) = 20T \).
- **Y-Position**: \( Y(T) = -5 \) (maintain adjacent lane).

#### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10)
- **X-Position**: \( X(T) = 20T \).
- **Y-Position**: \( Y(T) = -5 + \frac{5}{3}(T - 7) \) (linear transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds).

### Position Estimates at Critical Intervals:

| Time (s) | X-Position (m) | Y-Position (m) | Description                     |
|----------|----------------|----------------|---------------------------------|
| T = 0    | 0              | 0              | Starting point                  |
| T = 1    | 20             | -1.67          | Lane change in progress         |
| T = 2    | 40             | -3.33          | Lane change in progress         |
| T = 3    | 60             | -5             | In adjacent lane                |
| T = 4    | 80             | -5             | Bypassing obstruction           |
| T = 5    | 100            | -5             | Passing obstruction             |
| T = 6    | 120            | -5             | Bypassing obstruction           |
| T = 7    | 140            | -5             | Start lane change back          |
| T = 8    | 160            | -3.33          | Lane change back in progress    |
| T = 9    | 180            | -1.67          | Lane change back in progress    |
| T = 10   | 200            | 0              | Back in original lane           |

### Notes:
- The vehicle maintains a speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) throughout the maneuver.
- The obstruction is bypassed between T = 4 and T = 6.
- Lane changes are smooth and completed within 3 seconds each.

This plan ensures the vehicle navigates around the obstruction safely while maintaining the required speed.
