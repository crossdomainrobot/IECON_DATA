To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break the process into key phases: **lane transition**, **bypassing the obstruction**, and **returning to the original lane**. We'll calculate the vehicle's position at 1-second intervals, ensuring the speed remains above 60 km/h.

### **Given Data**
- **Initial position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)  
- **Obstruction position**: (X, Y) = (100, 0)  
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5  
- **Initial velocity**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s  
- **Minimum speed**: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s

### **Assumptions**
1. The lane change is smooth and takes 2 seconds to transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5.  
2. The vehicle travels at a constant speed of 20 m/s during the maneuver.  
3. The bypass phase occurs between X = 100 and X = 120 (to ensure sufficient clearance).  
4. The return to the original lane takes 2 seconds.

### **Route Plan**
We calculate the vehicle's position (X, Y) at 1-second intervals:

#### **Phase 1: Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2)**
- Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.  
- Y changes linearly: Y(T) = -2.5 * T.  
- X increases at 20 m/s: X(T) = 20 * T.  

| Time (T) | X Position | Y Position |
|----------|------------|------------|
| 0        | 0          | 0          |
| 1        | 20         | -2.5       |
| 2        | 40         | -5         |

---

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)**
- Maintain Y = -5 while traveling past the obstruction.  
- X increases at 20 m/s: X(T) = 40 + 20 * (T - 2).  

| Time (T) | X Position | Y Position |
|----------|------------|------------|
| 3        | 60         | -5         |
| 4        | 80         | -5         |
| 5        | 100        | -5         |
| 6        | 120        | -5         |

---

#### **Phase 3: Returning to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)**
- Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.  
- Y changes linearly: Y(T) = -5 + 2.5 * (T - 6).  
- X increases at 20 m/s: X(T) = 120 + 20 * (T - 6).  

| Time (T) | X Position | Y Position |
|----------|------------|------------|
| 7        | 140        | -2.5       |
| 8        | 160        | 0          |

---

#### **Phase 4: Continuing in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)**
- Maintain Y = 0 while traveling forward.  
- X increases at 20 m/s: X(T) = 160 + 20 * (T - 8).  

| Time (T) | X Position | Y Position |
|----------|------------|------------|
| 9        | 180        | 0          |
| 10       | 200        | 0          |

---

### **Summary of Positions**
| Time (T) | X Position | Y Position |
|----------|------------|------------|
| 0        | 0          | 0          |
| 1        | 20         | -2.5       |
| 2        | 40         | -5         |
| 3        | 60         | -5         |
| 4        | 80         | -5         |
| 5        | 100        | -5         |
| 6        | 120        | -5         |
| 7        | 140        | -2.5       |
| 8        | 160        | 0          |
| 9        | 180        | 0          |
| 10       | 200        | 0          |

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
