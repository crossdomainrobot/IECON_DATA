To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break down the vehicle¡¯s movement into phases: **lane transition**, **bypassing the obstruction**, and **returning to the original lane**. We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals, maintaining a speed above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).

---

### **Given:**
- **Initial position:** \( (X, Y) = (0, 0) \)
- **Obstruction position:** \( (100, 0) \)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate:** \( Y = -5 \)
- **Initial velocity:** 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum speed:** 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle accelerates or decelerates smoothly during lane transitions.
2. The lane transition takes 2 seconds (1 second to move to the adjacent lane and 1 second to return).
3. The vehicle moves laterally at a constant rate during lane transitions.
4. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s along the X-axis except during lane transitions.

### **Route Plan:**

#### **Phase 1: Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2)**
- **T = 0:** \( (0, 0) \)  
  Start in the outer lane.
- **T = 1:** \( (20, -2.5) \)  
  Move halfway to the adjacent lane.
- **T = 2:** \( (40, -5) \)  
  Complete the transition to the adjacent lane.

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)**
- **T = 3:** \( (60, -5) \)  
  Continue in the adjacent lane.
- **T = 4:** \( (80, -5) \)  
  Approach the obstruction.
- **T = 5:** \( (100, -5) \)  
  Reach the obstruction¡¯s X-coordinate.
- **T = 6:** \( (120, -5) \)  
  Pass the obstruction.

#### **Phase 3: Returning to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)**
- **T = 7:** \( (140, -2.5) \)  
  Move halfway back to the original lane.
- **T = 8:** \( (160, 0) \)  
  Complete the transition to the original lane.

#### **Phase 4: Continuing in the Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)**
- **T = 9:** \( (180, 0) \)  
  Continue in the original lane.
- **T = 10:** \( (200, 0) \)  
  Final position.

### **Summary of Positions:**
| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |
| 2        | (40, -5)        |
| 3        | (60, -5)        |
| 4        | (80, -5)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -5)       |
| 7        | (140, -2.5)     |
| 8        | (160, 0)        |
| 9        | (180, 0)        |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

### **Key Points:**
1. The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s throughout, ensuring it exceeds the minimum speed requirement of 16.67 m/s.
2. The lane transitions are completed smoothly within 2 seconds each.
3. The obstruction is successfully bypassed at \( T = 5 \).
