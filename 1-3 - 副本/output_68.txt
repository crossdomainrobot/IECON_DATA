To plan the route for your vehicle to bypass the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we need to break the maneuver into key phases:

1. **Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds):** Move from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
2. **Bypass Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 7 seconds):** Travel past the obstruction at X = 100 while staying in the adjacent lane.
3. **Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds):** Transition back to the outer lane (Y = 0).

### Assumptions:
- **Speed:** Maintain a constant speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) throughout.
- **Lateral Movement:** Assume smooth lateral transitions at a constant rate.
- **Obstruction:** Located at X = 100 m, Y = 0.

### Step-by-Step Plan:

#### 1. Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds):
- **Lateral Movement:** Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.
- **Lateral Velocity:** \( \frac{-5 \, \text{m}}{2 \, \text{s}} = -2.5 \, \text{m/s} \).
- **Position at T = 1 second:**
  - X = 20 m (20 m/s ¡Á 1 s).
  - Y = -2.5 m (starting at 0 and moving at -2.5 m/s).
- **Position at T = 2 seconds:**
  - X = 40 m.
  - Y = -5 m (fully transitioned to the adjacent lane).

#### 2. Bypass Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 7 seconds):
- **Lateral Position:** Stay at Y = -5.
- **Position at T = 3 seconds:**
  - X = 60 m.
  - Y = -5 m.
- **Position at T = 4 seconds:**
  - X = 80 m.
  - Y = -5 m.
- **Position at T = 5 seconds:**
  - X = 100 m (obstruction bypassed).
  - Y = -5 m.
- **Position at T = 6 seconds:**
  - X = 120 m.
  - Y = -5 m.
- **Position at T = 7 seconds:**
  - X = 140 m.
  - Y = -5 m.

#### 3. Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds):
- **Lateral Movement:** Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.
- **Lateral Velocity:** \( \frac{5 \, \text{m}}{3 \, \text{s}} \approx 1.67 \, \text{m/s} \).
- **Position at T = 8 seconds:**
  - X = 160 m.
  - Y = -3.33 m (starting at -5 and moving at 1.67 m/s).
- **Position at T = 9 seconds:**
  - X = 180 m.
  - Y = -1.67 m.
- **Position at T = 10 seconds:**
  - X = 200 m.
  - Y = 0 m (fully returned to the original lane).

### Summary of Positions:
- **T = 1 second:** (20, -2.5)
- **T = 2 seconds:** (40, -5)
- **T = 3 seconds:** (60, -5)
- **T = 4 seconds:** (80, -5)
- **T = 5 seconds:** (100, -5)
- **T = 6 seconds:** (120, -5)
- **T = 7 seconds:** (140, -5)
- **T = 8 seconds:** (160, -3.33)
- **T = 9 seconds:** (180, -1.67)
- **T = 10 seconds:** (200, 0)

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining speed and safely transitions between lanes.
