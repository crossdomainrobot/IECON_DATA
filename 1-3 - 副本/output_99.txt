To plan the route for your vehicle, we¡¯ll break down the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):**  
   Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while maintaining a speed exceeding 60 km/h.

2. **Bypassing the Obstruction:**  
   Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until you¡¯ve passed the obstruction at X = 100.

3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0):**  
   Transition back to the outer lane (Y = 0) after bypassing the obstruction.

### Given:
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s  
- Speed must exceed 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s  
- Obstruction at (100, 0)  
- Adjacent lane at Y = -5  

### Assumptions:
- Lane changes take approximately 2 seconds each.  
- The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s during the maneuver.

### Step-by-Step Route Planning:

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (Y = 0 ¡ú Y = -5)**  
- **Time:** T = 0 to T = 2 seconds  
- **Lateral Movement:** Y transitions linearly from 0 to -5 over 2 seconds.  
- **Longitudinal Movement:** X increases at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |
| 2        | 40    | -5    |

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (Y = -5)**  
- **Time:** T = 2 to T = 6 seconds  
- **Lateral Movement:** Y remains at -5.  
- **Longitudinal Movement:** X increases at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |

#### **Phase 3: Lane Change Back to Original Lane (Y = -5 ¡ú Y = 0)**  
- **Time:** T = 6 to T = 8 seconds  
- **Lateral Movement:** Y transitions linearly from -5 to 0 over 2 seconds.  
- **Longitudinal Movement:** X increases at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |
| 8        | 160   | 0     |

---

### Final Positions Over 10 Seconds:

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |
| 2        | 40    | -5    |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |
| 8        | 160   | 0     |
| 9        | 180   | 0     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### Summary:
- The vehicle successfully transitions to the adjacent lane, bypasses the obstruction, and returns to the original lane while maintaining a speed exceeding 60 km/h.  
- The maneuver is completed by T = 8 seconds, and the vehicle continues traveling in the original lane afterward.
