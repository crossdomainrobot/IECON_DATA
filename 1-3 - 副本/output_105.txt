To construct a route planning for your vehicle while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h and transitioning lanes to bypass the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into phases and estimate your position (X, Y) at 1-second intervals. Here¡¯s the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Assumptions**
1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - Starting position: (0, 0)
   - Obstruction position: (100, 0)
   - Adjacent lane Y-coordinate: Y = -5
   - Initial speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
   - Minimum speed: >60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
   - Time interval: 1 second

2. **Maneuver Phases**:
   - **Phase 1**: Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5)
   - **Phase 2**: Bypass the obstruction (stay in Y = -5 until X > 100)
   - **Phase 3**: Transition back to the original lane (Y = 0)

3. **Lane Transition**:
   - Assume smooth lateral movement over 2 seconds for each lane change.

### **Route Planning**
We¡¯ll calculate your position (X, Y) at T = 1, 2, ..., 10 seconds.

#### **Phase 1: Transition to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2)**
- Lateral movement: Y transitions from 0 to -5 over 2 seconds.
- Speed: Maintained at 72 km/h (20 m/s).
- Positions:
  - T = 0: (0, 0)
  - T = 1: (20, -2.5) [Midway in lane change]
  - T = 2: (40, -5) [Fully in adjacent lane]

#### **Phase 2: Bypass Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)**
- Lateral position: Y = -5 (stay in adjacent lane).
- Speed: Maintained at 72 km/h (20 m/s).
- Positions:
  - T = 3: (60, -5)
  - T = 4: (80, -5)
  - T = 5: (100, -5) [Reach obstruction position]
  - T = 6: (120, -5) [Fully bypassed obstruction]

#### **Phase 3: Transition Back to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)**
- Lateral movement: Y transitions from -5 to 0 over 2 seconds.
- Speed: Maintained at 72 km/h (20 m/s).
- Positions:
  - T = 7: (140, -2.5) [Midway in lane change]
  - T = 8: (160, 0) [Fully in original lane]

#### **Continue in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)**
- Lateral position: Y = 0 (stay in original lane).
- Speed: Maintained at 72 km/h (20 m/s).
- Positions:
  - T = 9: (180, 0)
  - T = 10: (200, 0)

### **Summary of Positions**
| Time (T) | Position (X, Y)   |
|----------|-------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)           |
| 1        | (20, -2.5)       |
| 2        | (40, -5)         |
| 3        | (60, -5)         |
| 4        | (80, -5)         |
| 5        | (100, -5)        |
| 6        | (120, -5)        |
| 7        | (140, -2.5)      |
| 8        | (160, 0)         |
| 9        | (180, 0)         |
| 10       | (200, 0)         |

### **Key Points**
- The maneuver is completed by T = 8 seconds, and you return to your original lane.
- Speed remains constant at 72 km/h throughout the maneuver.
- The obstruction is safely bypassed.
