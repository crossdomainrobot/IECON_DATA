To plan the route for your vehicle, we¡¯ll break down the problem into key steps and estimate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals. Here¡¯s the plan:

### Key Steps:
1. **Initial Movement (T = 0 to T = 3):** Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
2. **Bypass the Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7):** Move in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) past the obstruction at X = 100.
3. **Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10):** Transition back to the outer lane (Y = 0).

### Assumptions:
- Your vehicle¡¯s initial speed is **72 km/h (20 m/s)**.
- You must maintain a speed **above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)**.
- Lane transitions take **3 seconds** each.
- The obstruction is at **X = 100 meters**.

### Route Plan:
#### 1. **Transition to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 3):**
   - **Lateral Movement (Y):** Move from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds.
   - **Longitudinal Movement (X):** Travel at 20 m/s.
   - **Positions:**
     - T = 0: (0, 0)
     - T = 1: (20, -1.67)
     - T = 2: (40, -3.33)
     - T = 3: (60, -5)

#### 2. **Bypass the Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7):**
   - **Lateral Movement (Y):** Stay at Y = -5.
   - **Longitudinal Movement (X):** Travel at 20 m/s.
   - **Positions:**
     - T = 4: (80, -5)
     - T = 5: (100, -5)
     - T = 6: (120, -5)
     - T = 7: (140, -5)

#### 3. **Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10):**
   - **Lateral Movement (Y):** Move from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.
   - **Longitudinal Movement (X):** Travel at 20 m/s.
   - **Positions:**
     - T = 8: (160, -3.33)
     - T = 9: (180, -1.67)
     - T = 10: (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (T) | Position (X, Y)  |
|----------|------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)           |
| 1        | (20, -1.67)      |
| 2        | (40, -3.33)      |
| 3        | (60, -5)         |
| 4        | (80, -5)         |
| 5        | (100, -5)        |
| 6        | (120, -5)        |
| 7        | (140, -5)        |
| 8        | (160, -3.33)     |
| 9        | (180, -1.67)     |
| 10       | (200, 0)         |

### Verification:
- **Speed:** Your speed remains at 20 m/s (72 km/h), which is above the required 60 km/h.
- **Obstruction:** You bypass the obstruction at X = 100 while in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
- **Lane Transitions:** You complete the lane transitions smoothly within 3 seconds each.

This plan ensures a safe and efficient maneuver around the obstruction while maintaining the required speed.
