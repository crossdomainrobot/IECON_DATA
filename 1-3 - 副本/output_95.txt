To construct a route planning for this scenario, we'll break it down into critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. The vehicle's initial velocity is 72 km/h, which is 20 m/s (since 72 km/h * 1000 m/km / 3600 s/h = 20 m/s). The vehicle must maintain a speed exceeding 60 km/h (16.67 m/s) throughout the maneuver.

### Assumptions:
1. **Lane Width**: The adjacent lane is at Y = -5, so the vehicle must move laterally by 5 meters.
2. **Obstacle Position**: The obstacle is at (100, 0).
3. **Time Intervals**: We¡¯ll calculate the position at 1-second intervals (T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10).

### Steps:
1. **Lane Change Phase**: The vehicle will transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) over a certain distance. We¡¯ll assume this takes 2 seconds.
2. **Bypass Phase**: The vehicle will travel in the adjacent lane until it has passed the obstacle at X = 100.
3. **Return Phase**: The vehicle will transition back to the original lane (Y = 0) over another 2 seconds.

### Calculations:
Let¡¯s calculate the positions step by step.

#### Lane Change Phase (T = 0 to 2 seconds):
- **Time Interval**: 2 seconds
- **Distance Traveled**: 20 m/s * 2 s = 40 meters
- **Lateral Movement**: From Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds (linear interpolation)

Positions:
- **T = 1**: X = 20, Y = -2.5
- **T = 2**: X = 40, Y = -5

#### Bypass Phase (T = 2 to 6 seconds):
- **Time Interval**: 4 seconds
- **Distance Traveled**: 20 m/s * 4 s = 80 meters
- **Lateral Movement**: Y remains at -5

Positions:
- **T = 3**: X = 60, Y = -5
- **T = 4**: X = 80, Y = -5
- **T = 5**: X = 100, Y = -5
- **T = 6**: X = 120, Y = -5

#### Return Phase (T = 6 to 8 seconds):
- **Time Interval**: 2 seconds
- **Distance Traveled**: 20 m/s * 2 s = 40 meters
- **Lateral Movement**: From Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds (linear interpolation)

Positions:
- **T = 7**: X = 140, Y = -2.5
- **T = 8**: X = 160, Y = 0

#### Final Phase (T = 8 to 10 seconds):
- **Time Interval**: 2 seconds
- **Distance Traveled**: 20 m/s * 2 s = 40 meters
- **Lateral Movement**: Y remains at 0

Positions:
- **T = 9**: X = 180, Y = 0
- **T = 10**: X = 200, Y = 0

### Summary of Positions:
- **T = 1**: (20, -2.5)
- **T = 2**: (40, -5)
- **T = 3**: (60, -5)
- **T = 4**: (80, -5)
- **T = 5**: (100, -5)
- **T = 6**: (120, -5)
- **T = 7**: (140, -2.5)
- **T = 8**: (160, 0)
- **T = 9**: (180, 0)
- **T = 10**: (200, 0)

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstacle, maintains a speed above 60 km/h, and returns to the original lane smoothly.
