To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed exceeding 60 km/h, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into phases:

1. **Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5):**  
   - This involves a lateral shift from Y = 0 to Y = -5.  
   - Assume this takes 2 seconds.  

2. **Bypass the obstruction:**  
   - Travel past the obstruction (X = 100) while staying in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  

3. **Return to the original lane (Y = 0):**  
   - Shift back to the original lane after bypassing the obstruction.  
   - Assume this takes another 2 seconds.  

### Key Details:
- **Initial velocity:** 72 km/h = 20 m/s.  
- **Minimum speed:** 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.  
- **Obstruction position:** (X = 100, Y = 0).  
- **Time interval:** 10 seconds.  

### Assumptions:
- The lateral shift (lane change) is smooth and linear.  
- Speed remains constant at 20 m/s throughout the maneuver.  

### Position Estimates:
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals.

#### Phase 1: Transition to the adjacent lane (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds):
- Lateral shift: Y changes linearly from 0 to -5 over 2 seconds.  
- Longitudinal movement: X increases at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m)          | Y (m)          |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| 0        | 0              | 0              |
| 1        | 20             | -2.5           |
| 2        | 40             | -5             |

#### Phase 2: Bypass the obstruction (T = 2 to T = 5 seconds):
- Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
- Continue longitudinal movement at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m)          | Y (m)          |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| 3        | 60             | -5             |
| 4        | 80             | -5             |
| 5        | 100            | -5             |

#### Phase 3: Return to the original lane (T = 5 to T = 7 seconds):
- Lateral shift: Y changes linearly from -5 to 0 over 2 seconds.  
- Continue longitudinal movement at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m)          | Y (m)          |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| 6        | 120            | -2.5           |
| 7        | 140            | 0              |

#### Phase 4: Continue in the original lane (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds):
- Stay in the original lane (Y = 0).  
- Continue longitudinal movement at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m)          | Y (m)          |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| 8        | 160            | 0              |
| 9        | 180            | 0              |
| 10       | 200            | 0              |

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |
| 2        | 40    | -5    |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -2.5  |
| 7        | 140   | 0     |
| 8        | 160   | 0     |
| 9        | 180   | 0     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h and safely returns to the original lane.
