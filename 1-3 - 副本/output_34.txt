To construct a route planning for your vehicle, we need to account for the lane transition, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane while maintaining a speed exceeding 60 km/h. Here¡¯s the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Assumptions and Setup**
1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - Starting point: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
   - Obstruction: (X, Y) = (100, 0)
   - Adjacent lane: Y = -5
   - Initial velocity: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
   - Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)

2. **Time Intervals:**
   - We¡¯ll calculate positions at 1-second intervals (T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10).

3. **Lane Transition:**
   - Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) smoothly over 3 seconds.
   - Maintain the adjacent lane while bypassing the obstruction (X = 100).
   - Return to the original lane (Y = 0) smoothly over 3 seconds.

### **Route Planning**
We¡¯ll outline the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at each second:

1. **T = 0:**
   - Position: (0, 0)
   - Action: Start moving toward the obstruction.

2. **T = 1:**
   - X = 20 m (20 m/s ¡Á 1 s)
   - Y = -1.67 m (transitioning to Y = -5 over 3 seconds)
   - Position: (20, -1.67)

3. **T = 2:**
   - X = 40 m
   - Y = -3.33 m
   - Position: (40, -3.33)

4. **T = 3:**
   - X = 60 m
   - Y = -5 m (fully in the adjacent lane)
   - Position: (60, -5)

5. **T = 4:**
   - X = 80 m
   - Y = -5 m (maintaining the adjacent lane)
   - Position: (80, -5)

6. **T = 5:**
   - X = 100 m
   - Y = -5 m (bypassing the obstruction)
   - Position: (100, -5)

7. **T = 6:**
   - X = 120 m
   - Y = -3.33 m (transitioning back to Y = 0 over 3 seconds)
   - Position: (120, -3.33)

8. **T = 7:**
   - X = 140 m
   - Y = -1.67 m
   - Position: (140, -1.67)

9. **T = 8:**
   - X = 160 m
   - Y = 0 m (fully back in the original lane)
   - Position: (160, 0)

10. **T = 9:**
    - X = 180 m
    - Y = 0 m
    - Position: (180, 0)

11. **T = 10:**
    - X = 200 m
    - Y = 0 m
    - Position: (200, 0)

### **Summary**
The vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane smoothly over 3 seconds, maintains the adjacent lane while bypassing the obstruction, and returns to the original lane smoothly over the next 3 seconds. The speed remains constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h), ensuring it exceeds the minimum requirement of 16.67 m/s (60 km/h).
