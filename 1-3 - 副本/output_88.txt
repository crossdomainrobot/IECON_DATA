To plan the route, we'll need to break down the vehicle's movement into segments: transitioning to the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. Here¡¯s the step-by-step plan:

### Given:
- **Initial Position**: (0, 0)
- **Obstruction Position**: (100, 0)
- **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5
- **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- **Time Interval**: 10 seconds

### Assumptions:
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s throughout the maneuver.
2. The lane change is smooth and takes 2 seconds to transition fully.
3. The vehicle stays in the adjacent lane until it has bypassed the obstruction.

### Step 1: Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)
- **Time**: T = 0 to T = 2 seconds
- **X-coordinate**: X = 20 m/s * T
- **Y-coordinate**: Linearly transitions from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.

#### Positions:
- **T = 0 s**: (0, 0)
- **T = 1 s**: (20, -2.5)
- **T = 2 s**: (40, -5)

### Step 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 7 seconds)
- **Time**: T = 2 to T = 7 seconds
- **X-coordinate**: X = 40 + 20 m/s * (T - 2)
- **Y-coordinate**: Y = -5 (stays in the adjacent lane)

#### Positions:
- **T = 3 s**: (60, -5)
- **T = 4 s**: (80, -5)
- **T = 5 s**: (100, -5)
- **T = 6 s**: (120, -5)
- **T = 7 s**: (140, -5)

### Step 3: Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 9 seconds)
- **Time**: T = 7 to T = 9 seconds
- **X-coordinate**: X = 140 + 20 m/s * (T - 7)
- **Y-coordinate**: Linearly transitions from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.

#### Positions:
- **T = 8 s**: (160, -2.5)
- **T = 9 s**: (180, 0)

### Step 4: Continue in Original Lane (T = 9 to T = 10 seconds)
- **Time**: T = 9 to T = 10 seconds
- **X-coordinate**: X = 180 + 20 m/s * (T - 9)
- **Y-coordinate**: Y = 0 (stays in the original lane)

#### Positions:
- **T = 10 s**: (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions:
- **T = 0 s**: (0, 0)
- **T = 1 s**: (20, -2.5)
- **T = 2 s**: (40, -5)
- **T = 3 s**: (60, -5)
- **T = 4 s**: (80, -5)
- **T = 5 s**: (100, -5)
- **T = 6 s**: (120, -5)
- **T = 7 s**: (140, -5)
- **T = 8 s**: (160, -2.5)
- **T = 9 s**: (180, 0)
- **T = 10 s**: (200, 0)

This plan ensures the vehicle navigates around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
