To plan the vehicle¡¯s route while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypass the obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Return to the original lane (Y = 0)**

### Key Assumptions:
- **Initial speed:** 72 km/h (20 m/s)  
- **Minimum speed:** 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)  
- **Obstruction location:** (100, 0)  
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate:** Y = -5  
- **Time step:** 1 second  

### Phase 1: Transition to the Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 3)
Assume the lane change takes 3 seconds. During this time, the vehicle moves laterally from Y = 0 to Y = -5 while maintaining a speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s).  

#### Vehicle Positions:
- **T = 0:** (0, 0)  
- **T = 1:** (20, -1.67)  
- **T = 2:** (40, -3.33)  
- **T = 3:** (60, -5)  

### Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7)
The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while bypassing the obstruction at X = 100.  

#### Vehicle Positions:
- **T = 4:** (80, -5)  
- **T = 5:** (100, -5)  
- **T = 6:** (120, -5)  
- **T = 7:** (140, -5)  

### Phase 3: Return to the Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10)
The vehicle transitions back to the original lane (Y = 0) over 3 seconds while maintaining a speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s).  

#### Vehicle Positions:
- **T = 8:** (160, -3.33)  
- **T = 9:** (180, -1.67)  
- **T = 10:** (200, 0)  

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| 0        | (0, 0)          |  
| 1        | (20, -1.67)     |  
| 2        | (40, -3.33)     |  
| 3        | (60, -5)        |  
| 4        | (80, -5)        |  
| 5        | (100, -5)       |  
| 6        | (120, -5)       |  
| 7        | (140, -5)       |  
| 8        | (160, -3.33)    |  
| 9        | (180, -1.67)    |  
| 10       | (200, 0)        |  

### Notes:
- The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) throughout the maneuver.  
- The lane transitions are assumed to be smooth and take 3 seconds each.  
- The obstruction is bypassed safely by remaining in the adjacent lane from X = 60 to X = 140.
