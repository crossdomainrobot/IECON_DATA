To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into phases and calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals. The key phases are:

1. **Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):**  
   Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
2. **Bypass the Obstruction:**  
   Travel in the adjacent lane until the obstruction is cleared (X > 100).  
3. **Lane Change Back to Original Lane (Y = 0):**  
   Transition from the adjacent lane (Y = -5) back to the original lane (Y = 0).

### Assumptions:
- Vehicle speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s).  
- Lane change duration: 3 seconds (smooth transition).  
- Obstruction is at (100, 0).  
- Adjacent lane is at Y = -5.  

### Route Plan:

#### Phase 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 3)
- The vehicle moves laterally from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds.  
- Lateral velocity: \( \Delta Y = \frac{-5}{3} \approx -1.67 \, \text{m/s} \).  
- Longitudinal velocity: 20 m/s (constant).  

At each second:  
- \( X = 20 \cdot T \)  
- \( Y = -1.67 \cdot T \)  

| T (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|-------|-------|-------|  
| 0     | 0     | 0     |  
| 1     | 20    | -1.67 |  
| 2     | 40    | -3.33 |  
| 3     | 60    | -5    |  

#### Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 6)
- The vehicle continues in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
- Longitudinal velocity: 20 m/s (constant).  

At each second:  
- \( X = 60 + 20 \cdot (T - 3) \)  
- \( Y = -5 \)  

| T (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|-------|-------|-------|  
| 3     | 60    | -5    |  
| 4     | 80    | -5    |  
| 5     | 100   | -5    |  
| 6     | 120   | -5    |  

#### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 9)
- The vehicle moves laterally from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.  
- Lateral velocity: \( \Delta Y = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67 \, \text{m/s} \).  
- Longitudinal velocity: 20 m/s (constant).  

At each second:  
- \( X = 120 + 20 \cdot (T - 6) \)  
- \( Y = -5 + 1.67 \cdot (T - 6) \)  

| T (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|-------|-------|-------|  
| 6     | 120   | -5    |  
| 7     | 140   | -3.33 |  
| 8     | 160   | -1.67 |  
| 9     | 180   | 0     |  

#### Phase 4: Continue in Original Lane (T = 9 to T = 10)
- The vehicle continues in the original lane (Y = 0).  
- Longitudinal velocity: 20 m/s (constant).  

At T = 10:  
- \( X = 180 + 20 \cdot (10 - 9) = 200 \)  
- \( Y = 0 \)  

| T (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|-------|-------|-------|  
| 9     | 180   | 0     |  
| 10    | 200   | 0     |  

### Summary of Positions:
| T (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|-------|-------|-------|  
| 0     | 0     | 0     |  
| 1     | 20    | -1.67 |  
| 2     | 40    | -3.33 |  
| 3     | 60    | -5    |  
| 4     | 80    | -5    |  
| 5     | 100   | -5    |  
| 6     | 120   | -5    |  
| 7     | 140   | -3.33 |  
| 8     | 160   | -1.67 |  
| 9     | 180   | 0     |  
| 10    | 200   | 0     |  

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction smoothly while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
