To construct a route planning for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**

### Assumptions:
- Initial speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane)
- Obstruction at X = 100 meters

### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)
We'll perform the lane change over 2 seconds, ensuring smooth lateral movement.

#### Time Intervals:
- **T = 0s**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **T = 1s**: (X, Y) = (20, -2.5)  (Halfway through the lane change)
- **T = 2s**: (X, Y) = (40, -5)    (Completed lane change)

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)
We'll maintain the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while bypassing the obstruction.

#### Time Intervals:
- **T = 3s**: (X, Y) = (60, -5)
- **T = 4s**: (X, Y) = (80, -5)
- **T = 5s**: (X, Y) = (100, -5)  (Obstruction bypassed)

### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)
We'll perform the lane change back to the original lane over 2 seconds.

#### Time Intervals:
- **T = 6s**: (X, Y) = (120, -2.5)  (Halfway through the lane change)
- **T = 7s**: (X, Y) = (140, 0)     (Completed lane change)

### Summary of Positions:
Here is the vehicle¡¯s position at critical intervals over the next 10 seconds:

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |
| 2        | 40    | -5    |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -2.5  |
| 7        | 140   | 0     |
| 8        | 160   | 0     |
| 9        | 180   | 0     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### Notes:
- The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
- The lane changes are smooth and take 2 seconds each.
- The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while bypassing the obstruction at X = 100 meters.

This route planning ensures the vehicle navigates around the obstruction safely while maintaining the required speed.
