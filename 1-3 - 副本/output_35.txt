To plan the route while maintaining a speed exceeding 60 km/h (16.67 m/s), we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypass the obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Return to the original lane (Y = 0)**  

We¡¯ll assume a constant speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) for simplicity. The total time to cover 100 meters is \( \frac{100}{20} = 5 \) seconds. We¡¯ll estimate the positions at 1-second intervals.

### Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2.5 seconds)  
- Start at \( (0, 0) \).  
- Transition to the adjacent lane \( (Y = -5) \) over 2.5 seconds.  

At each second:  
- **T = 1**: \( X = 20 \times 1 = 20 \), \( Y = -2 \) (halfway to the adjacent lane).  
- **T = 2**: \( X = 40 \), \( Y = -4 \) (nearly in the adjacent lane).  
- **T = 2.5**: \( X = 50 \), \( Y = -5 \) (fully in the adjacent lane).  

---

### Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction (T = 2.5 to T = 7.5 seconds)  
- Continue in the adjacent lane \( (Y = -5) \) until bypassing the obstruction.  

At each second:  
- **T = 3**: \( X = 60 \), \( Y = -5 \).  
- **T = 4**: \( X = 80 \), \( Y = -5 \).  
- **T = 5**: \( X = 100 \), \( Y = -5 \) (bypassing the obstruction).  
- **T = 6**: \( X = 120 \), \( Y = -5 \).  
- **T = 7**: \( X = 140 \), \( Y = -5 \).  

---

### Phase 3: Return to the Original Lane (T = 7.5 to T = 10 seconds)  
- Transition back to the original lane \( (Y = 0) \) over 2.5 seconds.  

At each second:  
- **T = 8**: \( X = 160 \), \( Y = -3 \) (halfway back).  
- **T = 9**: \( X = 180 \), \( Y = -1 \) (nearly in the original lane).  
- **T = 10**: \( X = 200 \), \( Y = 0 \) (fully in the original lane).

### Summary of Positions:  
- **T = 0**: \( (0, 0) \)  
- **T = 1**: \( (20, -2) \)  
- **T = 2**: \( (40, -4) \)  
- **T = 3**: \( (60, -5) \)  
- **T = 4**: \( (80, -5) \)  
- **T = 5**: \( (100, -5) \)  
- **T = 6**: \( (120, -5) \)  
- **T = 7**: \( (140, -5) \)  
- **T = 8**: \( (160, -3) \)  
- **T = 9**: \( (180, -1) \)  
- **T = 10**: \( (200, 0) \)  

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed of 72 km/h and completes the maneuver safely within 10 seconds.
