To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we'll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Transition to the adjacent lane** (Y = -5).  
2. **Bypass the obstruction** (X = 100).  
3. **Return to the original lane** (Y = 0).  

### Assumptions:
- Initial speed: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.  
- Obstacle position: (100, 0).  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).  
- Time interval: 1 second.  

### Plan:
1. **Transition to the adjacent lane**:  
   - Start at (0, 0) and move to (20, -5) in 1 second (constant speed of 20 m/s).  
   - This assumes an immediate and smooth lane change.  

2. **Bypass the obstruction**:  
   - Continue traveling in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until X > 100.  

3. **Return to the original lane**:  
   - Transition back to Y = 0 after bypassing the obstruction.  

### Position Estimates:
Here¡¯s the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals:

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) | Description                     |
|----------|-------|-------|---------------------------------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     | Starting position               |
| 1        | 20    | -5    | Transition to adjacent lane     |
| 2        | 40    | -5    | Bypassing obstruction           |
| 3        | 60    | -5    | Bypassing obstruction           |
| 4        | 80    | -5    | Bypassing obstruction           |
| 5        | 100   | -5    | Reaching obstruction position   |
| 6        | 120   | -5    | Clear of obstruction            |
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  | Transition back to original lane|
| 8        | 160   | 0     | Returned to original lane       |
| 9        | 180   | 0     | Continuing in original lane     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     | Continuing in original lane     |

### Explanation:
1. **Transition to adjacent lane**: The vehicle moves from (0, 0) to (20, -5) in 1 second, maintaining a speed of 20 m/s.  
2. **Bypass obstruction**: The vehicle continues in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until it passes the obstruction at X = 100.  
3. **Return to original lane**: The vehicle transitions back to Y = 0 over 2 seconds (T = 6 to T = 8) to ensure smooth movement.  

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h and safely navigates around the obstruction.
