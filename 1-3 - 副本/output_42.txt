To construct a route planning for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break the maneuver into three phases: transitioning to the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. We'll estimate the vehicle's position at 1-second intervals over the next 10 seconds.

### Assumptions:
1. **Vehicle speed**: 72 km/h (20 m/s), maintained throughout.
2. **Lane width**: 5 meters (adjacent lane is at Y = -5).
3. **Obstruction location**: (100, 0).
4. **Time intervals**: 1 second (T = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10).
5. **Lane change duration**: 3 seconds (T = 0 to T = 3 for transitioning to the adjacent lane, and T = 7 to T = 10 for returning to the original lane).

### Route Planning:

#### **Phase 1: Transition to the Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 3)**
- **Lateral movement**: The vehicle moves from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds.
- **Lateral velocity**: \( \frac{-5 \, \text{m}}{3 \, \text{s}} \approx -1.67 \, \text{m/s} \).
- **X-position**: Increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (T) | X-position (m) | Y-position (m) |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| 0        | 0              | 0              |
| 1        | 20             | -1.67          |
| 2        | 40             | -3.33          |
| 3        | 60             | -5             |

#### **Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7)**
- **Lateral movement**: The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
- **X-position**: Increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (T) | X-position (m) | Y-position (m) |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| 4        | 80             | -5             |
| 5        | 100            | -5             |
| 6        | 120            | -5             |
| 7        | 140            | -5             |

#### **Phase 3: Return to the Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10)**
- **Lateral movement**: The vehicle moves from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.
- **Lateral velocity**: \( \frac{5 \, \text{m}}{3 \, \text{s}} \approx 1.67 \, \text{m/s} \).
- **X-position**: Increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (T) | X-position (m) | Y-position (m) |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| 8        | 160            | -3.33          |
| 9        | 180            | -1.67          |
| 10       | 200            | 0              |

### Notes:
1. The vehicle maintains a speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) throughout.
2. The lane changes are smooth and completed within 3 seconds each.
3. The obstruction is bypassed between T = 5 and T = 6.
4. The vehicle returns to the original lane by T = 10.
