To plan the route, we＊ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).**
2. **Bypass the obstruction at X = 100 while maintaining Y = -5.**
3. **Return to the original lane (Y = 0).**

### Given:
- Initial position: (X, Y) = (0, 0).
- Obstruction: (X, Y) = (100, 0).
- Adjacent lane: Y = -5.
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.
- Time intervals: T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 seconds.

### Assumptions:
- The lane change happens smoothly over 2 seconds (T = 1 to T = 3).
- The bypass occurs between X = 100 and X = 120.
- The return to the original lane happens over 2 seconds (T = 7 to T = 9).

### Route Plan:

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 3)**
- T = 0: (0, 0) 每 Start.
- T = 1: (20, -1.67) 每 Begin lane change.
- T = 2: (40, -3.33) 每 Continue lane change.
- T = 3: (60, -5) 每 Fully in the adjacent lane.

#### **Phase 2: Bypass Obstruction (T = 4 to T = 6)**
- T = 4: (80, -5) 每 Continue in the adjacent lane.
- T = 5: (100, -5) 每 Reach the obstruction.
- T = 6: (120, -5) 每 Pass the obstruction.

#### **Phase 3: Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 9)**
- T = 7: (140, -3.33) 每 Begin return.
- T = 8: (160, -1.67) 每 Continue return.
- T = 9: (180, 0) 每 Fully in the original lane.

#### **Phase 4: Continue Straight (T = 10)**
- T = 10: (200, 0) 每 Continue in the original lane.

### Summary Table:

| T (seconds) | X (meters) | Y (meters) |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| 0           | 0          | 0          |
| 1           | 20         | -1.67      |
| 2           | 40         | -3.33      |
| 3           | 60         | -5         |
| 4           | 80         | -5         |
| 5           | 100        | -5         |
| 6           | 120        | -5         |
| 7           | 140        | -3.33      |
| 8           | 160        | -1.67      |
| 9           | 180        | 0          |
| 10          | 200        | 0          |

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h, smoothly transitions lanes, bypasses the obstruction, and returns to the original lane within 10 seconds.
