To describe the trajectory of the vehicle as it switches lanes, passes the obstacle, and switches back, we need to break the maneuver into phases: accelerating, lane change, passing, and returning to the original lane. Here¡¯s a step-by-step description of the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) over time (T in seconds):

### Assumptions:
1. **Initial speed**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
2. **Maintain speed**: Above 60 km/h (~16.67 m/s).
3. **Lane width**: Assume a standard lane width of 3.5 meters. The left lane is at Y = -3.5 meters.
4. **Lane change duration**: Assume a smooth lane change takes 3 seconds.
5. **Passing distance**: The obstacle is at X = 100 meters, and the vehicle passes it safely in the left lane.

### Trajectory:

#### **T = 0 s**:  
- **Position**: (0, 0)  
- **Action**: Vehicle is in the right lane, moving at 20 m/s.

#### **T = 1 s**:  
- **Position**: (20, 0)  
- **Action**: Vehicle continues in the right lane.

#### **T = 2 s**:  
- **Position**: (40, 0)  
- **Action**: Vehicle begins preparing for the lane change.

#### **T = 3 s**:  
- **Position**: (60, -1.17)  
- **Action**: Vehicle starts moving into the left lane (Y changes gradually).

#### **T = 4 s**:  
- **Position**: (80, -2.33)  
- **Action**: Vehicle continues lane change.

#### **T = 5 s**:  
- **Position**: (100, -3.5)  
- **Action**: Vehicle completes the lane change and is now fully in the left lane.

#### **T = 6 s**:  
- **Position**: (120, -3.5)  
- **Action**: Vehicle passes the obstacle in the left lane.

#### **T = 7 s**:  
- **Position**: (140, -3.5)  
- **Action**: Vehicle continues in the left lane.

#### **T = 8 s**:  
- **Position**: (160, -2.33)  
- **Action**: Vehicle begins returning to the right lane.

#### **T = 9 s**:  
- **Position**: (180, -1.17)  
- **Action**: Vehicle continues returning to the right lane.

#### **T = 10 s**:  
- **Position**: (200, 0)  
- **Action**: Vehicle completes the maneuver and is back in the right lane.
