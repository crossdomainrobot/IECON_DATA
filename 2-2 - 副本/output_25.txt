To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:  
1. **Lane change to the left lane** (from \( T = 0 \) to \( T = 3 \)).  
2. **Passing the obstacle** (from \( T = 3 \) to \( T = 7 \)).  
3. **Lane change back to the right lane** (from \( T = 7 \) to \( T = 10 \)).  

### Assumptions:  
- The vehicle¡¯s initial speed is 72 km/h (20 m/s).  
- The left lane is 3.5 meters to the left of the right lane (\( Y = -3.5 \)).  
- The obstacle is at \( (100, 0) \).  
- The lane change takes 3 seconds, and the vehicle moves laterally at a constant rate.  
- The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s during the maneuver.  

### Trajectory:  
At each second, the vehicle¡¯s position \( (X, Y) \) is calculated as follows:  

#### Phase 1: Lane change to the left lane (\( T = 0 \) to \( T = 3 \))  
- \( X \) increases linearly: \( X = 20 \cdot T \).  
- \( Y \) decreases linearly from 0 to -3.5: \( Y = -\frac{3.5}{3} \cdot T \).  

| Time (s) | \( X \) (m) | \( Y \) (m) |  
|----------|-------------|-------------|  
| 0        | 0           | 0           |  
| 1        | 20          | -1.17       |  
| 2        | 40          | -2.33       |  
| 3        | 60          | -3.5        |  

#### Phase 2: Passing the obstacle (\( T = 3 \) to \( T = 7 \))  
- \( X \) continues to increase linearly: \( X = 60 + 20 \cdot (T - 3) \).  
- \( Y \) remains constant at -3.5.  

| Time (s) | \( X \) (m) | \( Y \) (m) |  
|----------|-------------|-------------|  
| 3        | 60          | -3.5        |  
| 4        | 80          | -3.5        |  
| 5        | 100         | -3.5        |  
| 6        | 120         | -3.5        |  
| 7        | 140         | -3.5        |  

#### Phase 3: Lane change back to the right lane (\( T = 7 \) to \( T = 10 \))  
- \( X \) continues to increase linearly: \( X = 140 + 20 \cdot (T - 7) \).  
- \( Y \) increases linearly from -3.5 to 0: \( Y = -3.5 + \frac{3.5}{3} \cdot (T - 7) \).  

| Time (s) | \( X \) (m) | \( Y \) (m) |  
|----------|-------------|-------------|  
| 7        | 140         | -3.5        |  
| 8        | 160         | -2.33       |  
| 9        | 180         | -1.17       |  
| 10       | 200         | 0           |

This trajectory ensures the vehicle safely changes lanes, passes the obstacle, and returns to the right lane while maintaining a speed of 72 km/h.
