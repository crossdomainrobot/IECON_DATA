To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we¡¯ll break it down into three phases:  
1. **Lane change to the left lane** (from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -3.5 \) meters, assuming a standard lane width of 3.5 meters).  
2. **Passing the obstacle** while staying in the left lane.  
3. **Lane change back to the right lane** (from \( Y = -3.5 \) meters to \( Y = 0 \)).  

### Assumptions:  
- Initial speed: \( 72 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \).  
- Maintain speed above \( 60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \).  
- Lane width: \( 3.5 \, \text{meters} \).  
- Obstacle is at \( (100, 0) \).  
- Lane change takes approximately 3 seconds each (to and from the left lane).  

### Trajectory:  
#### Phase 1: Lane change to the left lane (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)  
- At \( T = 0 \): \( (0, 0) \).  
- At \( T = 1 \): \( (20, -1.17) \).  
- At \( T = 2 \): \( (40, -2.33) \).  
- At \( T = 3 \): \( (60, -3.5) \).  

#### Phase 2: Passing the obstacle (T = 3 to T = 7 seconds)  
- At \( T = 4 \): \( (80, -3.5) \).  
- At \( T = 5 \): \( (100, -3.5) \).  
- At \( T = 6 \): \( (120, -3.5) \).  
- At \( T = 7 \): \( (140, -3.5) \).  

#### Phase 3: Lane change back to the right lane (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds)  
- At \( T = 8 \): \( (160, -2.33) \).  
- At \( T = 9 \): \( (180, -1.17) \).  
- At \( T = 10 \): \( (200, 0) \).  

### Summary of Positions:  
- \( T = 0 \): \( (0, 0) \).  
- \( T = 1 \): \( (20, -1.17) \).  
- \( T = 2 \): \( (40, -2.33) \).  
- \( T = 3 \): \( (60, -3.5) \).  
- \( T = 4 \): \( (80, -3.5) \).  
- \( T = 5 \): \( (100, -3.5) \).  
- \( T = 6 \): \( (120, -3.5) \).  
- \( T = 7 \): \( (140, -3.5) \).  
- \( T = 8 \): \( (160, -2.33) \).  
- \( T = 9 \): \( (180, -1.17) \).  
- \( T = 10 \): \( (200, 0) \).  

This trajectory ensures the vehicle maintains a speed of \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \) (72 km/h), stays in the left lane while passing the obstacle, and safely returns to the right lane.
