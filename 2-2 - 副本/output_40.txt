To describe the trajectory of the vehicle as it switches lanes, passes the obstacle, and switches back, we'll break the maneuver into phases: acceleration, lane change, passing, lane change back, and deceleration. We'll assume smooth transitions and constant acceleration where necessary. Here's the step-by-step trajectory:

---

### **Initial Conditions**
- **Initial position:** (0, 0)  
- **Initial speed:** 72 km/h = 20 m/s  
- **Obstacle position:** (100, 0)  
- **Left lane:** Y = -3.5 m (assuming a standard lane width of 3.5 m)  

---

### **Trajectory Plan**
1. **Acceleration (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds):**  
   - Accelerate slightly to ensure speed remains above 60 km/h.  
   - Speed increases to 22 m/s (79.2 km/h).  

2. **Lane Change (T = 2 to T = 4 seconds):**  
   - Smoothly move into the left lane (Y = -3.5 m).  

3. **Passing (T = 4 to T = 6 seconds):**  
   - Maintain speed and stay in the left lane to pass the obstacle.  

4. **Lane Change Back (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds):**  
   - Smoothly return to the right lane (Y = 0).  

5. **Deceleration (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds):**  
   - Gradually reduce speed back to 72 km/h (20 m/s).

| T = 3    | 60             | -1.75       | Midway into left lane           |
| T = 4    | 80             | -3.5        | Fully in left lane              |

| T = 7    | 140            | -1.75       | Midway back to right lane       |
| T = 8    | 160            | 0           | Fully in right lane             |
| T = 9    | 180            | 0           | Decelerating                    |
| T = 10   | 200            | 0           | Back to initial speed           |

### **Notes**
- The vehicle accelerates slightly to ensure it maintains highway speed.  
- Lane changes are smooth and take 2 seconds each.  
- The obstacle is passed safely in the left lane.  
- The vehicle returns to the right lane and adjusts speed back to the initial value.  

This trajectory ensures safe and efficient lane changes while maintaining highway speed.
