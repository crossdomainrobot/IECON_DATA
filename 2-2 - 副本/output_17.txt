To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:  
1. **Lane change to the left lane** (from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -3.5 \) meters, assuming a standard lane width of 3.5 meters).  
2. **Passing the obstacle** while staying in the left lane.  
3. **Lane change back to the right lane** (from \( Y = -3.5 \) meters to \( Y = 0 \)).  

### Assumptions:  
- The vehicle¡¯s initial speed is \( 72 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \).  
- The obstacle is at \( X = 100 \, \text{meters} \).  
- The lane change takes approximately 3 seconds (a smooth transition).  
- The vehicle maintains a speed of \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \) throughout the maneuver.  

### Trajectory:  
#### Phase 1: Lane change to the left lane (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)  
- The vehicle moves laterally from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -3.5 \) meters while continuing to move forward at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -1.17 |  
| 2        | 40    | -2.33 |  
| 3        | 60    | -3.5  |  

#### Phase 2: Passing the obstacle (T = 3 to T = 7 seconds)  
- The vehicle continues in the left lane (\( Y = -3.5 \) meters) and passes the obstacle at \( X = 100 \) meters.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 4        | 80    | -3.5  |  
| 5        | 100   | -3.5  |  
| 6        | 120   | -3.5  |  
| 7        | 140   | -3.5  |  

#### Phase 3: Lane change back to the right lane (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds)  
- The vehicle moves laterally from \( Y = -3.5 \) meters to \( Y = 0 \) while continuing to move forward at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 8        | 160   | -2.33 |  
| 9        | 180   | -1.17 |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |  

### Summary:  
The vehicle completes the lane-changing maneuver and passes the obstacle while maintaining a speed of \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \). The final position at \( T = 10 \) seconds is \( (200, 0) \).
