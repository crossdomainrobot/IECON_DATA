To plan the trajectory for the lane-changing maneuver, we'll break it down into phases: **acceleration, lane change, passing, and returning to the original lane**. Here's the step-by-step description:

### Assumptions:
1. Initial speed: **72 km/h (20 m/s)**.
2. Target speed: Maintain above **60 km/h (16.67 m/s)**.
3. Lane width: Assume **3.5 meters** per lane.
4. Lane change duration: Approximately **3 seconds** (smooth maneuver).
5. Passing distance: Ensure safe clearance ahead of the obstacle.

### Trajectory Calculation:
We'll calculate the vehicle's position every second (`T = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10`) in the form `(X, Y)`.

---

#### **Phase 1: Initial Approach (T = 0 to T = 2)**
- Continue in the right lane (`Y = 0`) at constant speed.
- Position at each second:
  - `T = 0`: `(0, 0)`
  - `T = 1`: `(20, 0)`
  - `T = 2`: `(40, 0)`

---

#### **Phase 2: Lane Change (T = 3 to T = 5)**
- Smoothly move to the left lane over 3 seconds.
- Lateral movement: Transition from `Y = 0` to `Y = -3.5` (left lane).
- Forward movement: Continue at 20 m/s.
- Position at each second:
  - `T = 3`: `(60, -1.17)` (1/3 of lane change)
  - `T = 4`: `(80, -2.33)` (2/3 of lane change)
  - `T = 5`: `(100, -3.5)` (fully in left lane)

---

#### **Phase 3: Passing the Obstacle (T = 6 to T = 8)**
- Continue in the left lane (`Y = -3.5`) at constant speed.
- Position at each second:
  - `T = 6`: `(120, -3.5)`
  - `T = 7`: `(140, -3.5)`
  - `T = 8`: `(160, -3.5)`

---

#### **Phase 4: Returning to the Right Lane (T = 9 to T = 10)**
- Smoothly move back to the right lane over 2 seconds.
- Lateral movement: Transition from `Y = -3.5` to `Y = 0`.
- Forward movement: Continue at 20 m/s.
- Position at each second:
  - `T = 9`: `(180, -1.75)` (1/2 of lane change)
  - `T = 10`: `(200, 0)` (fully in right lane)

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (T) | Position (X, Y)   |
|----------|-------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)           |
| 1        | (20, 0)          |
| 2        | (40, 0)          |
| 3        | (60, -1.17)      |
| 4        | (80, -2.33)      |
| 5        | (100, -3.5)      |
| 6        | (120, -3.5)      |
| 7        | (140, -3.5)      |
| 8        | (160, -3.5)      |
| 9        | (180, -1.75)     |
| 10       | (200, 0)         |

This trajectory ensures a safe and smooth lane-changing maneuver while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
