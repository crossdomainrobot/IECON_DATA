To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we can break down the maneuver into three phases: **lane change to the left**, **passing the obstacle**, and **lane change back to the right**. We'll assume the vehicle maintains a speed of **72 km/h (20 m/s)** and takes approximately **2 seconds** for each lane change (a smooth lateral movement).

---

### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Left (T = 0 to T = 2)
- **Initial position**: (0, 0)
- **Lateral movement**: Move from Y = 0 (right lane) to Y = -3.5 meters (left lane). Assume a smooth lateral displacement of 1.75 m/s.
- **Longitudinal movement**: Continue moving forward at 20 m/s.

**Positions**:
- T = 1: (20, -1.75)  
- T = 2: (40, -3.5)  

---

### Phase 2: Passing the Obstacle (T = 2 to T = 7)
- **Position**: Stay in the left lane (Y = -3.5) while passing the obstacle at (100, 0).
- **Longitudinal movement**: Continue moving forward at 20 m/s.

**Positions**:
- T = 3: (60, -3.5)  
- T = 4: (80, -3.5)  
- T = 5: (100, -3.5)  
- T = 6: (120, -3.5)  
- T = 7: (140, -3.5)  

---

### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Right (T = 7 to T = 9)
- **Lateral movement**: Move from Y = -3.5 meters (left lane) to Y = 0 (right lane). Assume a smooth lateral displacement of 1.75 m/s.
- **Longitudinal movement**: Continue moving forward at 20 m/s.

**Positions**:
- T = 8: (160, -1.75)  
- T = 9: (180, 0)  

---

### Final Trajectory Summary:
- T = 0: (0, 0)  
- T = 1: (20, -1.75)  
- T = 2: (40, -3.5)  
- T = 3: (60, -3.5)  
- T = 4: (80, -3.5)  
- T = 5: (100, -3.5)  
- T = 6: (120, -3.5)  
- T = 7: (140, -3.5)  
- T = 8: (160, -1.75)  
- T = 9: (180, 0)  

By T = 9, the vehicle has completed the maneuver and is back in the right lane, having passed the obstacle safely.
