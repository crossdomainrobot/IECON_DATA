To plan the trajectory, let¡¯s break down the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Left Lane**:  
   - You start at (0, 0) in the right lane and need to move to the left lane.  
   - Assume the lane width is about 3.5 meters, so you need to move laterally to Y = -3.5 meters.  
   - Let¡¯s assume the lane change takes about 3 seconds.

2. **Passing the Obstacle**:  
   - After completing the lane change, you continue driving in the left lane at a constant speed.  
   - The obstacle is at (100, 0), and you need to pass it safely.  

3. **Lane Change Back to the Right Lane**:  
   - Once you¡¯ve passed the obstacle, you move back to the right lane (Y = 0).  
   - This lane change also takes about 3 seconds.

### Assumptions:
- **Speed**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s (constant speed).  
- **Time Steps**: 1-second intervals.  
- **Lane Change Duration**: 3 seconds for each lane change.

### Trajectory Plan:

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change to the Left Lane (T = 0 to 3 seconds)**  
- At T = 0: (0, 0)  
- At T = 1: (20, -1.17)  
- At T = 2: (40, -2.33)  
- At T = 3: (60, -3.5)  

#### **Phase 2: Passing the Obstacle (T = 3 to 5 seconds)**  
- At T = 4: (80, -3.5)  
- At T = 5: (100, -3.5)  

#### **Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Right Lane (T = 5 to 8 seconds)**  
- At T = 6: (120, -2.33)  
- At T = 7: (140, -1.17)  
- At T = 8: (160, 0)  

#### **Phase 4: Continue in the Right Lane (T = 8 to 10 seconds)**  
- At T = 9: (180, 0)  
- At T = 10: (200, 0)

| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) in meters |
|----------|---------------------------|

| 1        | (20, -1.17)               |
| 2        | (40, -2.33)               |
| 3        | (60, -3.5)                |
| 4        | (80, -3.5)                |
| 5        | (100, -3.5)               |
| 6        | (120, -2.33)              |
| 7        | (140, -1.17)              |
| 8        | (160, 0)                  |
| 9        | (180, 0)                  |
| 10       | (200, 0)                  |
