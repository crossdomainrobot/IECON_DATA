To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we¡¯ll break it down into three phases:  
1. **Lane change to the left lane** (from T = 0 to T = 3 seconds).  
2. **Passing the obstacle** (from T = 3 to T = 7 seconds).  
3. **Lane change back to the right lane** (from T = 7 to T = 10 seconds).  

### Assumptions:
- The vehicle¡¯s initial speed is 72 km/h (20 m/s).  
- The obstacle is at (100, 0).  
- The left lane is at Y = -3.5 meters (assuming a standard lane width of 3.5 meters).  
- The lane change takes 3 seconds to complete smoothly.  
- The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.  

### Trajectory:
#### Phase 1: Lane change to the left lane (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)  
- At T = 0: (0, 0)  
- At T = 1: (20, -1.17)  
- At T = 2: (40, -2.33)  
- At T = 3: (60, -3.5)  

#### Phase 2: Passing the obstacle (T = 3 to T = 7 seconds)  
- At T = 4: (80, -3.5)  
- At T = 5: (100, -3.5)  
- At T = 6: (120, -3.5)  
- At T = 7: (140, -3.5)  

#### Phase 3: Lane change back to the right lane (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds)  
- At T = 8: (160, -2.33)  
- At T = 9: (180, -1.17)  
- At T = 10: (200, 0)  

### Summary of positions at each second:
- T = 0: (0, 0)  
- T = 1: (20, -1.17)  
- T = 2: (40, -2.33)  
- T = 3: (60, -3.5)  
- T = 4: (80, -3.5)  
- T = 5: (100, -3.5)  
- T = 6: (120, -3.5)  
- T = 7: (140, -3.5)  
- T = 8: (160, -2.33)  
- T = 9: (180, -1.17)  
- T = 10: (200, 0)  

This trajectory ensures the vehicle smoothly changes lanes, passes the obstacle, and returns to the right lane while maintaining a speed of 72 km/h.
