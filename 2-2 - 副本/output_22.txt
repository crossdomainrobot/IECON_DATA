To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we need to account for the initial speed, the lane-changing maneuver, and the return to the original lane after passing the obstacle. Here¡¯s a step-by-step breakdown of the vehicle¡¯s position at each second:

### Given:
- Initial position: (0, 0)
- Initial speed: 72 km/h = 20 m/s
- Obstacle position: (100, 0)
- Left lane is to the left (assume Y = -3 meters for the left lane)
- Maintain speed above 60 km/h (~16.67 m/s)

### Assumptions:
1. The vehicle takes 2 seconds to change lanes (gradual lateral movement).
2. The vehicle passes the obstacle and takes another 2 seconds to return to the right lane.
3. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s during the maneuver.

### Trajectory:
1. **T = 0 s**: (0, 0)  
   Initial position in the right lane.

2. **T = 1 s**: (20, -1.5)  
   Moving forward and starting to shift left into the left lane.

3. **T = 2 s**: (40, -3)  
   Fully in the left lane, passing the obstacle.

4. **T = 3 s**: (60, -3)  
   Continuing in the left lane.

5. **T = 4 s**: (80, -3)  
   Still in the left lane, approaching the obstacle.

6. **T = 5 s**: (100, -3)  
   Passing the obstacle in the left lane.

7. **T = 6 s**: (120, -1.5)  
   Starting to shift back to the right lane.

8. **T = 7 s**: (140, 0)  
   Fully back in the right lane.

9. **T = 8 s**: (160, 0)  
   Continuing in the right lane.

10. **T = 9 s**: (180, 0)  
    Still in the right lane.

11. **T = 10 s**: (200, 0)  
    Continuing in the right lane.

### Summary of Positions:
- T = 0: (0, 0)
- T = 1: (20, -1.5)
- T = 2: (40, -3)
- T = 3: (60, -3)
- T = 4: (80, -3)
- T = 5: (100, -3)
- T = 6: (120, -1.5)
- T = 7: (140, 0)
- T = 8: (160, 0)
- T = 9: (180, 0)
- T = 10: (200, 0)

This trajectory ensures the vehicle safely changes lanes, passes the obstacle, and returns to the right lane while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
