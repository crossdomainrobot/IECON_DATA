To describe the vehicle's trajectory for the lane-changing maneuver, we¡¯ll break it into phases: **acceleration, lane change, passing, and returning to the right lane**. The initial speed is **72 km/h (20 m/s)**, and we¡¯ll assume the vehicle accelerates slightly to ensure it maintains a speed above **60 km/h (16.67 m/s)**. Here¡¯s the trajectory:

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle accelerates to **25 m/s** (90 km/h) for the maneuver.
2. The lane change takes **2 seconds** to complete.
3. The left lane is **3.5 meters** to the left (Y = -3.5).
4. The obstacle is at **(100, 0)**, and the vehicle starts at **(0, 0)**.

### **Trajectory:**

#### **Phase 1: Acceleration and Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2)**
- **T = 0**: (0, 0)  
  Initial position, speed = 20 m/s.

- **T = 1**: (20, -1.75)  
  Vehicle starts moving leftward while accelerating.

- **T = 2**: (45, -3.5)  
  Vehicle completes the lane change and is now fully in the left lane.

#### **Phase 2: Passing the Obstacle (T = 2 to T = 6)**
- **T = 3**: (70, -3.5)  
  Vehicle continues in the left lane, passing the obstacle.

- **T = 4**: (95, -3.5)  
  Vehicle is just ahead of the obstacle.

- **T = 5**: (120, -3.5)  
  Vehicle has fully passed the obstacle.

#### **Phase 3: Returning to the Right Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)**
- **T = 6**: (145, -1.75)  
  Vehicle starts moving rightward to return to the right lane.

- **T = 7**: (170, 0)  
  Vehicle completes the lane change and is now fully in the right lane.

#### **Phase 4: Continuing in the Right Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)**
- **T = 8**: (195, 0)  
  Vehicle continues in the right lane.

- **T = 9**: (220, 0)  
  Vehicle maintains speed.

- **T = 10**: (245, 0)  
  Maneuver is complete.

| 3        | (70, -3.5)      |
| 4        | (95, -3.5)      |
| 5        | (120, -3.5)     |
| 6        | (145, -1.75)    |
| 7        | (170, 0)        |
| 8        | (195, 0)        |
| 9        | (220, 0)        |
| 10       | (245, 0)        |
