To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we¡¯ll break it down into three phases:  
1. **Lane change to the left lane** (from the right lane to the left lane).  
2. **Passing the obstacle** (driving past the obstacle in the left lane).  
3. **Lane change back to the right lane** (returning to the right lane after passing the obstacle).  

### Assumptions:  
- The vehicle¡¯s initial speed is **72 km/h (20 m/s)**.  
- The obstacle is at **(100, 0)**.  
- The left lane is at **Y = 3.5 meters** (assuming a standard lane width).  
- The lane change takes **3 seconds** to complete.  
- The vehicle maintains a speed of **20 m/s** throughout the maneuver.  

### Trajectory:  
We¡¯ll provide the position **(X, Y)** at each second (T = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10).  

#### Phase 1: Lane change to the left lane (T = 0 to T = 3)  
- The vehicle moves laterally from **Y = 0** to **Y = 3.5** over 3 seconds.  
- The X position increases linearly at 20 m/s.  

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | 1.17  |  
| 2        | 40    | 2.33  |  
| 3        | 60    | 3.5   |  

#### Phase 2: Passing the obstacle (T = 3 to T = 7)  
- The vehicle continues in the left lane (**Y = 3.5**) and passes the obstacle at **X = 100**.  

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 4        | 80    | 3.5   |  
| 5        | 100   | 3.5   |  
| 6        | 120   | 3.5   |  
| 7        | 140   | 3.5   |  

#### Phase 3: Lane change back to the right lane (T = 7 to T = 10)  
- The vehicle moves laterally from **Y = 3.5** to **Y = 0** over 3 seconds.  
- The X position continues to increase at 20 m/s.  

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 8        | 160   | 2.33  |  
| 9        | 180   | 1.17  |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |  

### Summary of Positions:  
| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | 1.17  |  
| 2        | 40    | 2.33  |  
| 3        | 60    | 3.5   |  
| 4        | 80    | 3.5   |  
| 5        | 100   | 3.5   |  
| 6        | 120   | 3.5   |  
| 7        | 140   | 3.5   |  
| 8        | 160   | 2.33  |  
| 9        | 180   | 1.17  |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |  

This trajectory ensures the vehicle safely changes lanes, passes the obstacle, and returns to the right lane while maintaining a speed of 72 km/h.
