To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we¡¯ll break it down into three phases:

1. **Initial Phase (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds):**  
   - The vehicle continues in the right lane, maintaining its speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s).  
   - Position at T = 1: (20, 0)  
   - Position at T = 2: (40, 0)  

2. **Lane-Changing Phase (T = 3 to T = 5 seconds):**  
   - The vehicle begins switching to the left lane. Assume a smooth lateral movement over 3 seconds.  
   - At T = 3: (60, 0)  
   - At T = 4: (80, -1.5) (midway through lane change, Y = -1.5 meters)  
   - At T = 5: (100, -3) (fully in the left lane, Y = -3 meters)  

3. **Passing and Returning Phase (T = 6 to T = 10 seconds):**  
   - The vehicle passes the obstacle and begins returning to the right lane.  
   - At T = 6: (120, -3)  
   - At T = 7: (140, -3)  
   - At T = 8: (160, -1.5) (midway through returning to the right lane)  
   - At T = 9: (180, 0) (fully back in the right lane)  
   - At T = 10: (200, 0)  

### Summary of Positions:
- T = 0: (0, 0)  
- T = 1: (20, 0)  
- T = 2: (40, 0)  
- T = 3: (60, 0)  
- T = 4: (80, -1.5)  
- T = 5: (100, -3)  
- T = 6: (120, -3)  
- T = 7: (140, -3)  
- T = 8: (160, -1.5)  
- T = 9: (180, 0)  
- T = 10: (200, 0)  

This trajectory ensures the vehicle maintains a speed of 72 km/h, safely passes the obstacle, and returns to the right lane.
