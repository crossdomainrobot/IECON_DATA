To describe the trajectory of the vehicle while performing the lane-changing maneuver, we¡¯ll break it down into phases: **acceleration**, **lane change**, **passing the obstacle**, and **lane change back**. The vehicle starts at (0, 0) with an initial speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s). We¡¯ll assume smooth transitions and a constant speed of 72 km/h during the maneuver.

### Key Assumptions:
1. **Lane width**: Assume each lane is 3.5 meters wide, so moving to the left lane requires a lateral displacement of 3.5 meters.
2. **Lane change duration**: Assume the lane change takes 3 seconds.
3. **Passing the obstacle**: The obstacle is at (100, 0), and we¡¯ll pass it safely in the left lane.
4. **Time step**: We¡¯ll provide positions at 1-second intervals.

### Trajectory:

#### **Phase 1: Initial Movement (T = 0 to T = 3)**
- The vehicle moves straight in the right lane while preparing to change lanes.
- At T = 3, the vehicle starts the lane change.

#### **Phase 2: Lane Change to the Left (T = 3 to T = 6)**
- The vehicle transitions smoothly to the left lane over 3 seconds.
- Lateral displacement increases linearly from Y = 0 to Y = 3.5.

#### **Phase 3: Passing the Obstacle (T = 6 to T = 9)**
- The vehicle continues in the left lane, passing the obstacle at (100, 0).

#### **Phase 4: Lane Change Back to the Right (T = 9 to T = 12)**
- The vehicle transitions back to the right lane over 3 seconds.
- Lateral displacement decreases linearly from Y = 3.5 to Y = 0.

### Notes:
- The X position increases linearly at 20 m/s (72 km/h).
- The Y position changes smoothly during the lane changes, ensuring a safe and comfortable maneuver.
- The obstacle is passed safely in the left lane between T = 6 and T = 9.
