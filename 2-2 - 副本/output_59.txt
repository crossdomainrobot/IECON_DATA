To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:  
1. **Lane change to the left lane** (from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -3.5 \) meters, assuming a standard lane width of 3.5 meters).  
2. **Passing the obstacle** while staying in the left lane.  
3. **Lane change back to the right lane** (from \( Y = -3.5 \) meters to \( Y = 0 \)).  

### Assumptions:  
- The vehicle¡¯s initial speed is \( 72 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \).  
- The obstacle is at \( (100, 0) \).  
- The lane change takes approximately 3 seconds (a smooth, safe maneuver).  
- The vehicle maintains a speed of \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \) throughout the maneuver.  

### Trajectory:  
We¡¯ll provide the position \( (X, Y) \) at each second \( T \):  

1. **Lane change to the left lane (T = 0 to T = 3):**  
   - \( T = 0 \): \( (0, 0) \)  
   - \( T = 1 \): \( (20, -1.17) \)  
   - \( T = 2 \): \( (40, -2.33) \)  
   - \( T = 3 \): \( (60, -3.5) \)  

2. **Passing the obstacle (T = 4 to T = 6):**  
   - \( T = 4 \): \( (80, -3.5) \)  
   - \( T = 5 \): \( (100, -3.5) \)  
   - \( T = 6 \): \( (120, -3.5) \)  

3. **Lane change back to the right lane (T = 7 to T = 9):**  
   - \( T = 7 \): \( (140, -2.33) \)  
   - \( T = 8 \): \( (160, -1.17) \)  
   - \( T = 9 \): \( (180, 0) \)  

### Summary of Positions:  
- \( T = 0 \): \( (0, 0) \)  
- \( T = 1 \): \( (20, -1.17) \)  
- \( T = 2 \): \( (40, -2.33) \)  
- \( T = 3 \): \( (60, -3.5) \)  
- \( T = 4 \): \( (80, -3.5) \)  
- \( T = 5 \): \( (100, -3.5) \)  
- \( T = 6 \): \( (120, -3.5) \)  
- \( T = 7 \): \( (140, -2.33) \)  
- \( T = 8 \): \( (160, -1.17) \)  
- \( T = 9 \): \( (180, 0) \)  

This trajectory ensures the vehicle safely changes lanes, passes the obstacle, and returns to the right lane while maintaining a speed of \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).
