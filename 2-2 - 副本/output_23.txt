To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:  
1. **Lane change to the left lane** (from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -3.5 \) meters, assuming a standard lane width of 3.5 meters).  
2. **Passing the obstacle** while staying in the left lane.  
3. **Lane change back to the right lane** (from \( Y = -3.5 \) meters to \( Y = 0 \)).  

### Assumptions:  
- The vehicle¡¯s speed is constant at 72 km/h (20 m/s).  
- The lane change takes approximately 3 seconds (smooth transition).  
- The obstacle is at \( X = 100 \) meters, and the vehicle starts at \( X = 0 \).  
- The left lane is at \( Y = -3.5 \) meters.  

### Trajectory:  
We¡¯ll calculate the position every second.  

#### Phase 1: Lane change to the left lane (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)  
- At \( T = 0 \): \( (X, Y) = (0, 0) \)  
- At \( T = 1 \): \( X = 20 \times 1 = 20 \), \( Y = -1.17 \) (1/3 of the lane change)  
- At \( T = 2 \): \( X = 40 \), \( Y = -2.33 \) (2/3 of the lane change)  
- At \( T = 3 \): \( X = 60 \), \( Y = -3.5 \) (fully in the left lane)  

#### Phase 2: Passing the obstacle (T = 3 to T = 7 seconds)  
- At \( T = 4 \): \( X = 80 \), \( Y = -3.5 \)  
- At \( T = 5 \): \( X = 100 \), \( Y = -3.5 \) (passing the obstacle)  
- At \( T = 6 \): \( X = 120 \), \( Y = -3.5 \)  
- At \( T = 7 \): \( X = 140 \), \( Y = -3.5 \)  

#### Phase 3: Lane change back to the right lane (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds)  
- At \( T = 8 \): \( X = 160 \), \( Y = -2.33 \) (1/3 of the lane change)  
- At \( T = 9 \): \( X = 180 \), \( Y = -1.17 \) (2/3 of the lane change)  
- At \( T = 10 \): \( X = 200 \), \( Y = 0 \) (fully back in the right lane)  

### Summary of Positions:  
- \( T = 0 \): \( (0, 0) \)  
- \( T = 1 \): \( (20, -1.17) \)  
- \( T = 2 \): \( (40, -2.33) \)  
- \( T = 3 \): \( (60, -3.5) \)  
- \( T = 4 \): \( (80, -3.5) \)  
- \( T = 5 \): \( (100, -3.5) \)  
- \( T = 6 \): \( (120, -3.5) \)  
- \( T = 7 \): \( (140, -3.5) \)  
- \( T = 8 \): \( (160, -2.33) \)  
- \( T = 9 \): \( (180, -1.17) \)  
- \( T = 10 \): \( (200, 0) \)  

This trajectory ensures the vehicle safely changes lanes, passes the obstacle, and returns to the right lane while maintaining a speed of 72 km/h.
