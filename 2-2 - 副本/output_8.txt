To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we¡¯ll break it into three phases:  
1. **Lane change to the left lane** (from the right lane to the left lane).  
2. **Passing the obstacle** (driving past the obstacle in the left lane).  
3. **Lane change back to the right lane** (returning to the right lane after passing the obstacle).  

### Assumptions:  
- The vehicle¡¯s initial speed is **72 km/h (20 m/s)**.  
- The left lane is **3.5 meters** to the left of the right lane (Y = -3.5).  
- The obstacle is at **(100, 0)**.  
- The lane change takes **3 seconds** (smooth transition).  
- The vehicle maintains a speed of **20 m/s** throughout the maneuver.  

### Trajectory:  
We¡¯ll calculate the position (X, Y) at each second (T = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10).  

#### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Left Lane (T = 0 to T = 3)  
- The vehicle moves laterally from Y = 0 to Y = -3.5 over 3 seconds.  
- The lateral position changes linearly: Y = -3.5 * (T / 3).  
- The longitudinal position increases at 20 m/s: X = 20 * T.  

#### Phase 2: Passing the Obstacle (T = 3 to T = 7)  
- The vehicle stays in the left lane (Y = -3.5).  
- The longitudinal position increases at 20 m/s: X = 20 * T.  

#### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Right Lane (T = 7 to T = 10)  
- The vehicle moves laterally from Y = -3.5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.  
- The lateral position changes linearly: Y = -3.5 + 3.5 * ((T - 7) / 3).  
- The longitudinal position increases at 20 m/s: X = 20 * T.  

### Positions at Each Second:  
| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m)       | Description                     |  
|----------|-------|-------------|---------------------------------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0           | Starting position               |  
| 1        | 20    | -1.17       | Lane change to the left lane    |  
| 2        | 40    | -2.33       | Lane change to the left lane    |  
| 3        | 60    | -3.5        | Fully in the left lane          |  
| 4        | 80    | -3.5        | Passing the obstacle            |  
| 5        | 100   | -3.5        | Passing the obstacle            |  
| 6        | 120   | -3.5        | Passing the obstacle            |  
| 7        | 140   | -3.5        | Starting lane change back       |  
| 8        | 160   | -2.33       | Lane change back to right lane  |  
| 9        | 180   | -1.17       | Lane change back to right lane  |  
| 10       | 200   | 0           | Fully back in the right lane    |  

### Summary:  
- The vehicle completes the lane change to the left lane by T = 3.  
- It passes the obstacle between T = 3 and T = 7.  
- It returns to the right lane by T = 10.  
- The speed is maintained at 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
