To describe the trajectory of the vehicle, we need to plan the lane-changing maneuver while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s). Here＊s a step-by-step breakdown of the positions (X, Y) at each second:

### Assumptions:
- The vehicle moves at a constant speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) during the maneuver.
- The lane width is approximately 3.5 meters.
- The lane change takes about 2 seconds to complete (a smooth lateral transition).

### Initial Conditions:
- Initial position: (0, 0) at T = 0.
- Obstacle position: (100, 0).

### Trajectory:
1. **T = 0 s**: (0, 0) 每 Starting position in the right lane.
2. **T = 1 s**: (20, 0) 每 Continue in the right lane.
3. **T = 2 s**: (40, 0) 每 Begin lane change to the left.
4. **T = 3 s**: (60, 1.75) 每 Midway through the lane change.
5. **T = 4 s**: (80, 3.5) 每 Complete lane change into the left lane.
6. **T = 5 s**: (100, 3.5) 每 Pass the obstacle in the left lane.
7. **T = 6 s**: (120, 3.5) 每 Continue in the left lane.
8. **T = 7 s**: (140, 3.5) 每 Begin lane change back to the right.
9. **T = 8 s**: (160, 1.75) 每 Midway through the lane change.
10. **T = 9 s**: (180, 0) 每 Complete lane change back into the right lane.
11. **T = 10 s**: (200, 0) 每 Continue in the right lane.

### Explanation:
- The vehicle travels 20 meters per second along the X-axis.
- The lane change is modeled as a smooth lateral transition over 2 seconds, moving from Y = 0 to Y = 3.5 meters.
- The obstacle is passed safely in the left lane between T = 4 s and T = 6 s.
- The vehicle returns to the right lane by T = 9 s and continues forward.

This trajectory ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h and safely navigates around the obstacle.
