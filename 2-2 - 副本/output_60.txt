To plan the trajectory, we need to break the maneuver into phases: accelerating to the left lane, maintaining the lane while passing the obstacle, and returning to the right lane. Here＊s the step-by-step trajectory:

---

### Assumptions:
1. **Initial speed**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
2. **Lane width**: Assume lanes are 3.5 meters wide.
3. **Lane change duration**: 2 seconds for each lane change.
4. **Passing distance**: Ensure the vehicle is fully in the left lane before passing the obstacle at \( X = 100 \).
5. **Return to right lane**: After passing the obstacle by a safe distance (e.g., \( X = 150 \)).

### Trajectory (positions (X, Y) at each second):

#### Phase 1: Lane change to the left (T = 0 to T = 2)
- **T = 0**: (0, 0) 每 Initial position in the right lane.
- **T = 1**: (20, 1.75) 每 Moving into the left lane.
- **T = 2**: (40, 3.5) 每 Fully in the left lane.

#### Phase 2: Passing the obstacle (T = 2 to T = 5)
- **T = 3**: (60, 3.5) 每 Maintaining the left lane.
- **T = 4**: (80, 3.5) 每 Approaching the obstacle.
- **T = 5**: (100, 3.5) 每 Passing the obstacle.

#### Phase 3: Lane change back to the right (T = 5 to T = 7)
- **T = 6**: (120, 1.75) 每 Moving into the right lane.
- **T = 7**: (140, 0) 每 Fully back in the right lane.

#### Phase 4: Continuing in the right lane (T = 7 to T = 10)
- **T = 8**: (160, 0).
- **T = 9**: (180, 0).
- **T = 10**: (200, 0).

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)           |
| 1        | (20, 1.75)       |
| 2        | (40, 3.5)        |
| 3        | (60, 3.5)        |
| 4        | (80, 3.5)        |
| 5        | (100, 3.5)       |
| 6        | (120, 1.75)      |
| 7        | (140, 0)         |
| 8        | (160, 0)         |
| 9        | (180, 0)         |
| 10       | (200, 0)         |

### Notes:
- The lane changes are smooth and take 2 seconds each.
- The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
- The obstacle is passed safely in the left lane.
- The vehicle returns to the right lane after a safe distance.
