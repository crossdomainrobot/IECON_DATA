To describe the vehicle's trajectory for the lane-changing maneuver, we'll break it down into three phases: **1) Lane change to the left**, **2) Passing the obstacle**, and **3) Lane change back to the right**. The initial speed is **72 km/h (20 m/s)**, and we'll assume smooth transitions for the lane changes, which take about **2 seconds each**. The obstacle is at **X = 100 m**, and we'll assume the left lane is at **Y = -3.5 m** (assuming lane width is 3.5 m).

### Trajectory Plan:
1. **Lane Change to the Left (T = 0 to T = 2):**
   - The vehicle moves from Y = 0 to Y = -3.5 m while continuing forward.
2. **Passing the Obstacle (T = 2 to T = 6):**
   - The vehicle stays in the left lane (Y = -3.5 m) and passes the obstacle.
3. **Lane Change Back to the Right (T = 6 to T = 8):**
   - The vehicle moves from Y = -3.5 m back to Y = 0.

### Position Calculations:
- **X(t) = Initial X + Speed ¡Á Time** (since speed is constant at 20 m/s).
- **Y(t)** changes during lane changes.

### Trajectory:
Here are the positions at each second:

- **T = 0 s**: (0, 0)  
  Initial position.

- **T = 1 s**: (20, -1.75)  
  Midway through the lane change to the left.

- **T = 2 s**: (40, -3.5)  
  Fully in the left lane.

- **T = 3 s**: (60, -3.5)  
  Continuing in the left lane.

- **T = 4 s**: (80, -3.5)  
  Approaching the obstacle.

- **T = 5 s**: (100, -3.5)  
  Passing the obstacle.

- **T = 6 s**: (120, -3.5)  
  Fully past the obstacle.

- **T = 7 s**: (140, -1.75)  
  Midway through the lane change back to the right.

- **T = 8 s**: (160, 0)  
  Fully back in the right lane.

- **T = 9 s**: (180, 0)  
  Continuing in the right lane.

- **T = 10 s**: (200, 0)  
  Continuing in the right lane.

This trajectory ensures the vehicle maintains a speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s), smoothly changes lanes, and safely passes the obstacle.
