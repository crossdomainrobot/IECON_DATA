To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll break the process into key phases:

1. **Initial Phase (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds): Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).**
2. **Bypass Phase (T = 3 to T = 7 seconds): Maintain the adjacent lane while passing the obstruction at X = 100.**
3. **Return Phase (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds): Transition back to the original lane (Y = 0).**

### Assumptions:
- Initial speed: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).
- Obstruction is at X = 100 meters.
- Smooth lane transitions take approximately 3 seconds each.
- Speed remains constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout.

### Route Plan:

#### 1. **Initial Phase (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds):**
   - **T = 0 seconds:** Starting position: (0, 0).
   - **T = 1 second:** Move linearly toward the adjacent lane. Position: (20, -1.67).
   - **T = 2 seconds:** Continue transitioning. Position: (40, -3.33).
   - **T = 3 seconds:** Fully in the adjacent lane. Position: (60, -5).

#### 2. **Bypass Phase (T = 3 to T = 7 seconds):**
   - **T = 4 seconds:** Continue in the adjacent lane. Position: (80, -5).
   - **T = 5 seconds:** Pass the obstruction. Position: (100, -5).
   - **T = 6 seconds:** Continue in the adjacent lane. Position: (120, -5).
   - **T = 7 seconds:** Prepare to return to the original lane. Position: (140, -5).

#### 3. **Return Phase (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds):**
   - **T = 8 seconds:** Begin transitioning back. Position: (160, -3.33).
   - **T = 9 seconds:** Continue transitioning. Position: (180, -1.67).
   - **T = 10 seconds:** Fully back in the original lane. Position: (200, 0).

### Summary of Positions:
- **T = 0 seconds:** (0, 0)
- **T = 1 second:** (20, -1.67)
- **T = 2 seconds:** (40, -3.33)
- **T = 3 seconds:** (60, -5)
- **T = 4 seconds:** (80, -5)
- **T = 5 seconds:** (100, -5)
- **T = 6 seconds:** (120, -5)
- **T = 7 seconds:** (140, -5)
- **T = 8 seconds:** (160, -3.33)
- **T = 9 seconds:** (180, -1.67)
- **T = 10 seconds:** (200, 0)

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h and smoothly transitions between lanes.
