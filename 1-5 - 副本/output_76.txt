To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Convert speed to meters per second (m/s):**
   - Initial speed: 72.0 km/h = (72.0 ¡Á 1000) / 3600 = 20 m/s
   - Minimum speed: 60.0 km/h = (60.0 ¡Á 1000) / 3600 = 16.67 m/s

2. **Determine the time required to reach the obstruction:**
   - Distance to obstruction: 100 meters
   - Time to reach obstruction: \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{100}{20} = 5 \) seconds

3. **Plan the lane transition:**
   - Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) before reaching the obstruction.
   - Assume the lane change takes 2 seconds (from T = 3 to T = 5).
   - Return to the original lane (Y = 0) after passing the obstruction.
   - Assume the return lane change takes another 2 seconds (from T = 5 to T = 7).

4. **Calculate positions at critical intervals:**
   - At T = 0: Starting point (0, 0)
   - At T = 1: (20, 0)
   - At T = 2: (40, 0)
   - At T = 3: (60, 0) ¡ª Begin lane change
   - At T = 4: (80, -2.5) ¡ª Midway in lane change
   - At T = 5: (100, -5) ¡ª Fully in adjacent lane, obstruction bypassed
   - At T = 6: (120, -2.5) ¡ª Begin return to original lane
   - At T = 7: (140, 0) ¡ª Fully back in original lane
   - At T = 8: (160, 0)
   - At T = 9: (180, 0)
   - At T = 10: (200, 0)

Here¡¯s the summarized route planning:

| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|-----------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, 0)         |
| 2        | (40, 0)         |
| 3        | (60, 0)         |
| 4        | (80, -2.5)      |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -2.5)     |
| 7        | (140, 0)        |
| 8        | (160, 0)        |
| 9        | (180, 0)        |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

This plan ensures you maintain a speed above 60 km/h while smoothly transitioning lanes to bypass the obstruction and return to your original lane.
