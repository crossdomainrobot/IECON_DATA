To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the steps into critical intervals. Here's the plan:

### **Given:**
- **Initial Position (T = 0):** (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Obstruction Position:** (X, Y) = (100, 0)
- **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate:** Y = -5
- **Initial Velocity:** 72.0 km/h (convert to m/s: 72 ¡Á 1000 / 3600 = 20 m/s)
- **Minimum Speed:** 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- **Time Intervals:** T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 seconds

### **Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle accelerates/decelerates smoothly.
2. Lane transitions are linear and take 2 seconds each (1 second to move into the adjacent lane and 1 second to return to the original lane).
3. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s during lane transitions.

### **Plan:**
1. **T = 0 to T = 3 seconds:** Move into the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while maintaining speed.
   - At T = 3 seconds, the vehicle is fully in the adjacent lane.
2. **T = 3 to T = 7 seconds:** Continue in the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction at X = 100.
3. **T = 7 to T = 10 seconds:** Return to the original lane (Y = 0) while maintaining speed.

### **Calculations:**

#### **X-coordinate (Distance Traveled):**
The vehicle moves at 20 m/s.  
X = Initial X + (Velocity ¡Á Time)  
At T = 0, X = 0  
At T = 1, X = 20  
At T = 2, X = 40  
At T = 3, X = 60  
At T = 4, X = 80  
At T = 5, X = 100  
At T = 6, X = 120  
At T = 7, X = 140  
At T = 8, X = 160  
At T = 9, X = 180  
At T = 10, X = 200  

#### **Y-coordinate (Lateral Position):**
- **T = 0 to T = 3 seconds:** Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5  
  Y decreases linearly: Y = 0 ¡ú -1.67 ¡ú -3.33 ¡ú -5  
- **T = 3 to T = 7 seconds:** Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5)  
- **T = 7 to T = 10 seconds:** Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0  
  Y increases linearly: Y = -5 ¡ú -3.33 ¡ú -1.67 ¡ú 0

### **Vehicle Positions at Critical Intervals:**

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m)     |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| T = 0    | 0     | 0         |
| T = 1    | 20    | -1.67     |
| T = 2    | 40    | -3.33     |
| T = 3    | 60    | -5        |
| T = 4    | 80    | -5        |
| T = 5    | 100   | -5        |
| T = 6    | 120   | -5        |
| T = 7    | 140   | -5        |
| T = 8    | 160   | -3.33     |
| T = 9    | 180   | -1.67     |
| T = 10   | 200   | 0         |

### **Summary:**
- The vehicle successfully navigates around the obstruction by transitioning to the adjacent lane and returning to the original lane while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
