To plan your route around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, let¡¯s break down the maneuver into steps and track your vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals. Here¡¯s the plan:

---

### **Assumptions and Initial Conditions**
1. **Starting Position**: (0, 0) at T = 0.
2. **Obstruction Position**: (100, 0).
3. **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5.
4. **Initial Speed**: 72 km/h (20 m/s).
5. **Minimum Speed Constraint**: Must stay above 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).

---

### **Steps for Navigation**
1. **Transition to the Adjacent Lane**:
   - Begin at T = 0 and complete the lane change by T = 2 seconds.
   - Move laterally from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.
2. **Bypass the Obstruction**:
   - Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until you pass the obstruction at X = 100.
3. **Return to the Original Lane**:
   - Begin transitioning back to the original lane (Y = 0) after passing the obstruction.
   - Complete the lane change by T = 10 seconds.

### **Position Calculations**
1. **Longitudinal Distance (X)**:
   - At constant speed of 20 m/s, your position at time T is \( X = 20 \cdot T \).
2. **Lateral Distance (Y)**:
   - **T = 0 to T = 2**: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
     - \( Y = -2.5 \cdot T \).
   - **T = 2 to T = 5**: Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
   - **T = 5 to T = 10**: Transition back to Y = 0.
     - \( Y = -5 + (T - 5) \).

### **Position Table**
| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m)       | Description                         |
|----------|-------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| 0        | 0     | 0           | Start position                      |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5        | Transitioning to adjacent lane      |
| 2        | 40    | -5          | Fully in adjacent lane              |
| 3        | 60    | -5          | Bypassing obstruction               |
| 4        | 80    | -5          | Bypassing obstruction               |
| 5        | 100   | -5          | Passing obstruction                 |
| 6        | 120   | -4          | Transitioning back to original lane |
| 7        | 140   | -3          | Transitioning back to original lane |
| 8        | 160   | -2          | Transitioning back to original lane |
| 9        | 180   | -1          | Transitioning back to original lane |
| 10       | 200   | 0           | Fully back in original lane         |

### **Key Points**
- The lane transitions are smooth and completed within 2 seconds each.
- The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h), satisfying the speed constraint.
- The obstruction at X = 100 is successfully bypassed while staying in the adjacent lane.

This plan ensures you navigate around the obstruction safely and efficiently.
