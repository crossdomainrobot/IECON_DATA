To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the process into three phases:

1. **Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypass the obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Return to the original lane (Y = 0)**

Given:
- Initial velocity = 72 km/h = 20 m/s  
- Minimum speed = 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s  
- Obstruction at (100, 0)  
- Adjacent lane at Y = -5  

### Assumptions:
- The lane change is smooth and takes 2 seconds.  
- The bypassing maneuver takes 5 seconds (to ensure the obstruction is fully cleared).  
- The return to the original lane takes 2 seconds.  

### Critical Time Intervals:
- **T = 0 to T = 2**: Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
- **T = 2 to T = 7**: Bypass the obstruction (X = 100).  
- **T = 7 to T = 9**: Return to the original lane (Y = 0).  

### Position Calculations:
1. **T = 0 to T = 2 (Lane Change)**  
   - X = Initial velocity ¡Á time = 20 ¡Á T  
   - Y transitions linearly from 0 to -5.  

2. **T = 2 to T = 7 (Bypass Obstruction)**  
   - X = 40 (position at T = 2) + 20 ¡Á (T - 2)  
   - Y remains at -5.  

3. **T = 7 to T = 9 (Return to Original Lane)**  
   - X = 140 (position at T = 7) + 20 ¡Á (T - 7)  
   - Y transitions linearly from -5 to 0.  

### Position Estimates:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) | Description                |
|----------|-------|-------|----------------------------|
| T = 0    | 0     | 0     | Starting position          |
| T = 1    | 20    | -2.5  | Transitioning to lane Y=-5 |
| T = 2    | 40    | -5    | Fully in adjacent lane     |
| T = 3    | 60    | -5    | Bypassing obstruction      |
| T = 4    | 80    | -5    | Bypassing obstruction      |
| T = 5    | 100   | -5    | Bypassing obstruction      |
| T = 6    | 120   | -5    | Bypassing obstruction      |
| T = 7    | 140   | -5    | Bypassing obstruction      |
| T = 8    | 160   | -2.5  | Returning to original lane |
| T = 9    | 180   | 0     | Fully in original lane     |

### Summary:
- By T = 2, the vehicle is fully in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
- By T = 7, the vehicle has bypassed the obstruction at X = 100.  
- By T = 9, the vehicle has returned to the original lane (Y = 0).  
- Speed is maintained above 60 km/h throughout the maneuver.  

This plan ensures a smooth and safe transition around the obstruction.
