Alright, let's tackle this problem systematically. I'm trying to plan a route for my vehicle to navigate around an unexpected obstacle on the road. Here's how I'm approaching it:

### Understanding the Scenario

1. **Road Layout**: There are two parallel lanes. I'm currently in the outer lane, which we'll consider as the starting point with coordinates (0, 0).
   
2. **Obstacle Position**: There's an obstacle directly in my path at (100, 0). This means it's 100 meters ahead in the same lane I'm currently in.

3. **Adjacent Lane**: The adjacent lane is at Y = -5. To bypass the obstacle, I need to transition to this lane, go past the obstacle, and then return to my original lane.

4. **Vehicle Speed**: My initial speed is 72.0 km/h, and I must maintain a speed exceeding 60 km/h throughout the maneuver.

### Converting Speed to Meters per Second

First, it's easier to work with speed in meters per second (m/s) since our distances are in meters.

- **Initial Speed**: 72.0 km/h = 72,000 meters / 3,600 seconds = 20 m/s
- **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h = 60,000 meters / 3,600 seconds ¡Ö 16.67 m/s

### Planning the Lane Change

To avoid the obstacle, I need to:

1. **Change to the Adjacent Lane**: Move from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
2. **Bypass the Obstacle**: Ensure that at X = 100, I'm in the adjacent lane.
3. **Return to the Original Lane**: Move back from Y = -5 to Y = 0.

### Estimating Positions Over Time

We'll estimate the vehicle's position at each second (T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10) while ensuring the speed remains above 16.67 m/s.

#### Assumptions:

- **Lane Change Duration**: Let's assume it takes 2 seconds to change lanes (both to the adjacent lane and back).
  
- **Constant Speed During Lane Change**: For simplicity, I'll assume the speed remains at 20 m/s during lane changes.

#### Calculations:

1. **From T = 0 to T = 2**: Changing to the adjacent lane.
   - **X-coordinate**: Since speed is 20 m/s, in 2 seconds, the vehicle moves 40 meters.
     - At T = 1: X = 20, Y = 0 (starting lane change)
     - At T = 2: X = 40, Y = -5 (completed lane change)
   
2. **From T = 2 to T = 6**: Driving in the adjacent lane.
   - **X-coordinate**: At 20 m/s, from T = 2 to T = 6 is 4 seconds, so 80 meters.
     - At T = 3: X = 60, Y = -5
     - At T = 4: X = 80, Y = -5
     - At T = 5: X = 100, Y = -5 (bypassing the obstacle)
     - At T = 6: X = 120, Y = -5

3. **From T = 6 to T = 8**: Changing back to the original lane.
   - **X-coordinate**: At 20 m/s, from T = 6 to T = 8 is 2 seconds, so 40 meters.
     - At T = 7: X = 140, Y = -5 (starting lane change)
     - At T = 8: X = 160, Y = 0 (completed lane change)
   
4. **From T = 8 to T = 10**: Continuing in the original lane.
   - **X-coordinate**: At 20 m/s, from T = 8 to T = 10 is 2 seconds, so 40 meters.
     - At T = 9: X = 180, Y = 0
     - At T = 10: X = 200, Y = 0

### Verifying Speed

Throughout the maneuver, the speed was maintained at 20 m/s, which is above the required minimum of 16.67 m/s.

### Summary of Positions

Here's a table summarizing the vehicle's position at each second:

| Time (T) | X-coordinate | Y-coordinate |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| 0        | 0            | 0            |
| 1        | 20           | 0            |
| 2        | 40           | -5           |
| 3        | 60           | -5           |
| 4        | 80           | -5           |
| 5        | 100          | -5           |
| 6        | 120          | -5           |
| 7        | 140          | -5           |
| 8        | 160          | 0            |
| 9        | 180          | 0            |
| 10       | 200          | 0            |

### Final Route Plan

- **T = 0 to T = 2**: Transition from outer lane to adjacent lane.
- **T = 2 to T = 6**: Drive in the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstacle at X = 100.
- **T = 6 to T = 8**: Transition back to the outer lane.
- **T = 8 to T = 10**: Continue driving in the outer lane.

This plan ensures that the vehicle successfully navigates around the obstacle while maintaining the required speed.
