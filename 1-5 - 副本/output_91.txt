To plan the lane transition and bypass the obstruction, we'll break down the vehicle's movement into critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. Here's the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Given:**
- Starting position: \( (X, Y) = (0, 0) \)
- Obstruction at \( (100, 0) \)
- Adjacent lane at \( Y = -5 \)
- Initial velocity: \( 72.0 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \)
- Minimum speed: \( 60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \)

---

### **Plan:**
1. **Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds):**
   - Move from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \) over 3 seconds.
   - Maintain a constant speed of \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).

2. **Bypass Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7 seconds):**
   - Stay in the adjacent lane \( Y = -5 \) while passing the obstruction at \( X = 100 \).

3. **Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds):**
   - Move from \( Y = -5 \) back to \( Y = 0 \) over 3 seconds.

---

### **Position Estimates:**

#### **1. Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds):**
- At \( T = 1 \): \( X = 20 \), \( Y = -1.67 \) (transitioning)
- At \( T = 2 \): \( X = 40 \), \( Y = -3.33 \) (transitioning)
- At \( T = 3 \): \( X = 60 \), \( Y = -5 \) (fully in adjacent lane)

#### **2. Bypass Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7 seconds):**
- At \( T = 4 \): \( X = 80 \), \( Y = -5 \)
- At \( T = 5 \): \( X = 100 \), \( Y = -5 \) (passing obstruction)
- At \( T = 6 \): \( X = 120 \), \( Y = -5 \)
- At \( T = 7 \): \( X = 140 \), \( Y = -5 \)

#### **3. Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds):**
- At \( T = 8 \): \( X = 160 \), \( Y = -3.33 \) (transitioning)
- At \( T = 9 \): \( X = 180 \), \( Y = -1.67 \) (transitioning)
- At \( T = 10 \): \( X = 200 \), \( Y = 0 \) (fully in original lane)

### **Summary Table:**

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m)       |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| 0        | 0     | 0           |
| 1        | 20    | -1.67       |
| 2        | 40    | -3.33       |
| 3        | 60    | -5          |
| 4        | 80    | -5          |
| 5        | 100   | -5          |
| 6        | 120   | -5          |
| 7        | 140   | -5          |
| 8        | 160   | -3.33       |
| 9        | 180   | -1.67       |
| 10       | 200   | 0           |

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above \( 60 \, \text{km/h} \).
