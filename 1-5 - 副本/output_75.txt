To plan the route and estimate the vehicle's position at critical intervals, we'll break down the maneuver into the following phases:

1. **Initial phase**: Traveling in the outer lane (Y = 0) until approaching the obstruction.
2. **Lane change phase**: Transitioning to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
3. **Bypass phase**: Traveling in the adjacent lane to bypass the obstruction.
4. **Return phase**: Transitioning back to the original lane (Y = 0).
5. **Post-bypass phase**: Continuing in the original lane.

### Assumptions:
- Vehicle speed: 72 km/h = 20 m/s (constant).
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).
- Obstruction is at X = 100 meters.
- Lane changes are linear and take 2 seconds each (reasonable assumption for smooth driving).

### Steps:

1. **Initial phase (T = 0 to T = 4 seconds)**:
   - The vehicle travels in the outer lane (Y = 0).
   - Position at T = 0: (0, 0).
   - Position at T = 1: (20, 0).
   - Position at T = 2: (40, 0).
   - Position at T = 3: (60, 0).
   - Position at T = 4: (80, 0).

2. **Lane change phase (T = 4 to T = 6 seconds)**:
   - The vehicle transitions from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
   - Lateral movement: -2.5 m/s (since it takes 2 seconds to move 5 meters).
   - Position at T = 5: (100, -2.5).
   - Position at T = 6: (120, -5).

3. **Bypass phase (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)**:
   - The vehicle travels in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) to bypass the obstruction.
   - Position at T = 7: (140, -5).
   - Position at T = 8: (160, -5).

4. **Return phase (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds)**:
   - The vehicle transitions back to the original lane (Y = 0).
   - Lateral movement: +2.5 m/s (since it takes 2 seconds to move 5 meters).
   - Position at T = 9: (180, -2.5).
   - Position at T = 10: (200, 0).

### Summary of positions:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | 0     |
| 2        | 40    | 0     |
| 3        | 60    | 0     |
| 4        | 80    | 0     |
| 5        | 100   | -2.5  |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -5    |
| 8        | 160   | -5    |
| 9        | 180   | -2.5  |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed of 72 km/h, bypasses the obstruction, and returns to the original lane within 10 seconds.
