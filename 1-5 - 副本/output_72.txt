To plan the route and estimate the vehicle's position at critical intervals, we'll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**: Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction**: Maintain the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstruction at X = 100.
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**: Transition from the adjacent lane (Y = -5) back to the outer lane (Y = 0).

### Assumptions:
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s.
- Must maintain speed > 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.
- Time intervals: 1-second increments.
- Lane change duration: 3 seconds (smooth transition).

### Route Planning:
#### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)
- **Time**: T = 0 to T = 3 seconds.
- **Lateral Movement**: Y transitions linearly from 0 to -5.
- **Longitudinal Movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -1.67 |
| 2        | 40    | -3.33 |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |

#### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (Y = -5)
- **Time**: T = 3 to T = 7 seconds.
- **Lateral Movement**: Y remains at -5.
- **Longitudinal Movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -5    |

#### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)
- **Time**: T = 7 to T = 10 seconds.
- **Lateral Movement**: Y transitions linearly from -5 to 0.
- **Longitudinal Movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 8        | 160   | -3.33 |
| 9        | 180   | -1.67 |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -1.67 |
| 2        | 40    | -3.33 |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -5    |
| 8        | 160   | -3.33 |
| 9        | 180   | -1.67 |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h and smoothly transitions between lanes.
