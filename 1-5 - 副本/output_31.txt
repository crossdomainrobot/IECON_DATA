To plan the route, we need to calculate the vehicle's position over time, ensuring that it transitions to the adjacent lane, bypasses the obstruction, and returns to the original lane while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h. Here's the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Given:**
- **Starting position:** (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Obstruction position:** (X, Y) = (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate:** Y = -5
- **Initial velocity:** 72.0 km/h = 20 m/s (converted to meters per second)
- **Minimum speed:** 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s
- **Time intervals:** T = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10 seconds

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle accelerates/decelerates smoothly to maintain speed.
2. Lane transitions are instantaneous for simplicity (in reality, this would take a small amount of time).
3. The vehicle travels in a straight line along the X-axis unless transitioning lanes.

### **Route Plan:**
1. **From T = 0 to T = 2 seconds:**  
   - The vehicle travels in the outer lane (Y = 0) at 20 m/s.  
   - Positions:  
     - T = 0: (0, 0)  
     - T = 1: (20, 0)  
     - T = 2: (40, 0)  

2. **At T = 3 seconds:**  
   - The vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
   - Position: (60, -5)  

3. **From T = 4 to T = 6 seconds:**  
   - The vehicle continues in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) at 20 m/s.  
   - Positions:  
     - T = 4: (80, -5)  
     - T = 5: (100, -5)  
     - T = 6: (120, -5)  

4. **At T = 7 seconds:**  
   - The vehicle transitions back to the original lane (Y = 0).  
   - Position: (140, 0)  

5. **From T = 8 to T = 10 seconds:**  
   - The vehicle continues in the original lane (Y = 0) at 20 m/s.  
   - Positions:  
     - T = 8: (160, 0)  
     - T = 9: (180, 0)  
     - T = 10: (200, 0)

### **Summary of Positions:**
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| 0        | (0, 0)          |  
| 1        | (20, 0)         |  
| 2        | (40, 0)         |  
| 3        | (60, -5)        |  
| 4        | (80, -5)        |  
| 5        | (100, -5)       |  
| 6        | (120, -5)       |  
| 7        | (140, 0)        |  
| 8        | (160, 0)        |  
| 9        | (180, 0)        |  
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

### **Key Points:**
- The vehicle bypasses the obstruction at T = 5 seconds, staying in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
- Speed remains constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h), ensuring the minimum speed requirement is met.  
- The lane transitions are completed smoothly, and the vehicle returns to its original lane by T = 7 seconds.
