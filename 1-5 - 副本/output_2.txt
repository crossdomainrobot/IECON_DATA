To navigate around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we'll plan a smooth lane transition, bypass the obstruction, and return to the original lane. Here's the step-by-step route planning:

---

### **Given:**
- **Initial Position (T = 0):** (0.0, 0)  
- **Obstruction Position:** (100, 0)  
- **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate:** Y = -5  
- **Initial Velocity:** 72.0 km/h (20 m/s)  
- **Minimum Speed Constraint:** >60 km/h (16.67 m/s)  
- **Time Interval:** 10 seconds  

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle accelerates/decelerates smoothly for lane transitions.  
2. Lane transitions take approximately 2 seconds each.  
3. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s during straight sections.

### **Route Plan:**

#### **1. Lane Transition to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2):**
   - Move from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.  
   - X increases at 20 m/s:  
     - At T = 1: X = 20, Y = -2.5  
     - At T = 2: X = 40, Y = -5  

#### **2. Bypass Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6):**
   - Continue in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) at 20 m/s.  
   - At T = 3: X = 60, Y = -5  
   - At T = 4: X = 80, Y = -5  
   - At T = 5: X = 100, Y = -5 (bypassing the obstruction)  
   - At T = 6: X = 120, Y = -5  

#### **3. Lane Transition Back to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8):**
   - Move from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.  
   - X increases at 20 m/s:  
     - At T = 7: X = 140, Y = -2.5  
     - At T = 8: X = 160, Y = 0  

#### **4. Continue in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10):**
   - Maintain Y = 0 and speed of 20 m/s.  
   - At T = 9: X = 180, Y = 0  
   - At T = 10: X = 200, Y = 0

### **Summary of Positions:**
| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| 0        | (0.0, 0)        |  
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |  
| 2        | (40, -5)        |  
| 3        | (60, -5)        |  
| 4        | (80, -5)        |  
| 5        | (100, -5)       |  
| 6        | (120, -5)       |  
| 7        | (140, -2.5)     |  
| 8        | (160, 0)        |  
| 9        | (180, 0)        |  
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h while safely bypassing the obstruction and returning to the original lane.
