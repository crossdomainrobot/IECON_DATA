To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypass the obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Return to the original lane (Y = 0)**  

### Assumptions:
- **Initial speed**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s (constant speed is maintained).  
- **Lane width**: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).  
- **Obstruction location**: (100, 0).  
- **Time to change lanes**: 2 seconds (smooth transition).  

### Step-by-Step Plan:
#### Phase 1: Transition to the adjacent lane (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)
- At T = 0: (0, 0)  
- At T = 1: (20, -2.5)  
- At T = 2: (40, -5)  

#### Phase 2: Bypass the obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6 seconds)
- At T = 3: (60, -5)  
- At T = 4: (80, -5)  
- At T = 5: (100, -5)  
- At T = 6: (120, -5)  

#### Phase 3: Return to the original lane (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)
- At T = 7: (140, -2.5)  
- At T = 8: (160, 0)  

#### Phase 4: Continue in the original lane (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds)
- At T = 9: (180, 0)  
- At T = 10: (200, 0)  

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| 0        | (0, 0)          |  
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |  
| 2        | (40, -5)        |  
| 3        | (60, -5)        |  
| 4        | (80, -5)        |  
| 5        | (100, -5)       |  
| 6        | (120, -5)       |  
| 7        | (140, -2.5)     |  
| 8        | (160, 0)        |  
| 9        | (180, 0)        |  
| 10       | (200, 0)        |  

This plan ensures a smooth lane transition, bypasses the obstruction, and returns to the original lane while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
