To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we'll break down the maneuver into key intervals. We'll assume constant speed and smooth lane transitions. Here's the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Given:**
- **Initial position:** \( (X, Y) = (0.0, 0) \)
- **Obstruction position:** \( (X, Y) = (100, 0) \)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate:** \( Y = -5 \)
- **Initial velocity:** \( 72.0 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \)
- **Minimum speed:** \( 60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \)

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).
2. Lane transitions (leftward and rightward) each take **2 seconds**.
3. The vehicle spends **6 seconds** in the adjacent lane to bypass the obstruction.

---

### **Route Plan:**

#### **1. Lane Transition to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2):**
- **Lateral movement:** Transition from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \).
- **Longitudinal movement:** \( X \) increases at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| T = 0    | 0     | 0     |
| T = 1    | 20    | -2.5  |
| T = 2    | 40    | -5    |

---

#### **2. Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 8):**
- **Lateral position:** Remain at \( Y = -5 \).
- **Longitudinal movement:** \( X \) increases at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| T = 3    | 60    | -5    |
| T = 4    | 80    | -5    |
| T = 5    | 100   | -5    |
| T = 6    | 120   | -5    |
| T = 7    | 140   | -5    |
| T = 8    | 160   | -5    |

---

#### **3. Lane Transition Back to Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10):**
- **Lateral movement:** Transition from \( Y = -5 \) to \( Y = 0 \).
- **Longitudinal movement:** \( X \) increases at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| T = 9    | 180   | -2.5  |
| T = 10   | 200   | 0     |

---

### **Summary of Critical Positions:**

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) | Description                  |
|----------|-------|-------|------------------------------|
| T = 0    | 0     | 0     | Starting position            |
| T = 1    | 20    | -2.5  | Transitioning left           |
| T = 2    | 40    | -5    | Entered adjacent lane        |
| T = 5    | 100   | -5    | Bypassing obstruction        |
| T = 8    | 160   | -5    | Preparing to return          |
| T = 9    | 180   | -2.5  | Transitioning right          |
| T = 10   | 200   | 0     | Returned to original lane    |

---

### **Verification:**
- **Speed:** Maintained at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \) (72 km/h), exceeding the minimum requirement of \( 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \) (60 km/h).
- **Obstruction avoidance:** The vehicle is in the adjacent lane (\( Y = -5 \)) when \( X = 100 \).

This plan ensures a smooth and safe maneuver around the obstruction.
