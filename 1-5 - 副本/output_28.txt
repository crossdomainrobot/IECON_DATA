To plan the route for your vehicle, we¡¯ll break it down into critical steps and calculate the position (X, Y) at 1-second intervals. Here's the plan:

### Key Assumptions:
1. **Initial Position**: (0, 0) at T = 0.
2. **Obstruction**: Located at (100, 0).
3. **Adjacent Lane**: Y = -5.
4. **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h (20 m/s).
5. **Minimum Speed**: Must exceed 60 km/h (16.67 m/s) throughout.
6. **Time Interval**: 1 second.

### Steps:
1. **Accelerate slightly to ensure speed exceeds 60 km/h**.
2. **Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5)** by T = 3 seconds.
3. **Bypass the obstruction** by T = 7 seconds.
4. **Return to the original lane (Y = 0)** by T = 10 seconds.

### Calculations:
- **Distance traveled per second**: 20 meters (constant speed of 72 km/h).
- **Lane transition time**: 3 seconds to move laterally from Y = 0 to Y = -5.

### Estimated Positions (X, Y) at T = 1, 2, ..., 10 seconds:
| Time (T) | X (Distance) | Y (Lateral Position) | Notes |
|----------|--------------|----------------------|-------|
| 0        | 0            | 0                    | Start |
| 1        | 20           | 0                    | Moving straight |
| 2        | 40           | -1.67                | Begin lane transition |
| 3        | 60           | -5                   | Fully in adjacent lane |
| 4        | 80           | -5                   | Bypassing obstruction |
| 5        | 100          | -5                   | Obstruction bypassed |
| 6        | 120          | -5                   | Continue in adjacent lane |
| 7        | 140          | -3.33                | Begin return to original lane |
| 8        | 160          | -1.67                | Transitioning back |
| 9        | 180          | 0                    | Fully in original lane |
| 10       | 200          | 0                    | Continue straight |

### Explanation:
1. **T = 0 to T = 1**: Vehicle moves straight at 20 m/s, covering 20 meters.
2. **T = 1 to T = 3**: Vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) over 2 seconds.
3. **T = 3 to T = 5**: Vehicle continues in the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction at X = 100.
4. **T = 5 to T = 7**: Vehicle begins returning to the original lane.
5. **T = 7 to T = 10**: Vehicle completes the transition back to the original lane.

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed exceeding 60 km/h and safely navigates around the obstruction.
