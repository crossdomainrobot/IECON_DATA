To navigate around the obstruction while maintaining a speed exceeding 60 km/h, we'll plan the lane transition and return in a smooth and safe manner. Here¡¯s the step-by-step route planning:

### Key Assumptions:
1. **Initial Position**: (0, 0) at \( T = 0 \).
2. **Obstruction Position**: (100, 0).
3. **Adjacent Lane**: \( Y = -5 \).
4. **Initial Speed**: 72 km/h (20 m/s).
5. **Minimum Speed**: Must exceed 60 km/h (16.67 m/s) throughout.

### Plan:
1. **Lane Change to Adjacent Lane**:
   - Begin transitioning to the adjacent lane at \( T = 0 \).
   - Complete the lane change by \( T = 3 \) seconds.
2. **Bypass the Obstruction**:
   - Stay in the adjacent lane until \( X > 100 \) meters.
3. **Return to Original Lane**:
   - Begin transitioning back to the original lane at \( T = 6 \) seconds.
   - Complete the transition by \( T = 9 \) seconds.

### Position Estimates:
The vehicle¡¯s position \((X, Y)\) is calculated at 1-second intervals.

#### 1. **Lane Change Phase (\( T = 0 \) to \( T = 3 \))**:
   - **Lateral Movement**: Transition from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \) linearly over 3 seconds.
   - **Longitudinal Movement**: \( X \) increases at 20 m/s.

   | Time (s) | \( X \) (m) | \( Y \) (m) |
   |----------|-------------|-------------|
   | 0        | 0           | 0           |
   | 1        | 20          | -1.67       |
   | 2        | 40          | -3.33       |
   | 3        | 60          | -5          |

#### 2. **Bypass Phase (\( T = 3 \) to \( T = 6 \))**:
   - Stay in the adjacent lane (\( Y = -5 \)) while continuing to move forward.

   | Time (s) | \( X \) (m) | \( Y \) (m) |
   |----------|-------------|-------------|
   | 4        | 80          | -5          |
   | 5        | 100         | -5          |
   | 6        | 120         | -5          |

#### 3. **Return to Original Lane Phase (\( T = 6 \) to \( T = 9 \))**:
   - **Lateral Movement**: Transition from \( Y = -5 \) to \( Y = 0 \) linearly over 3 seconds.
   - **Longitudinal Movement**: \( X \) increases at 20 m/s.

   | Time (s) | \( X \) (m) | \( Y \) (m) |
   |----------|-------------|-------------|
   | 7        | 140         | -3.33       |
   | 8        | 160         | -1.67       |
   | 9        | 180         | 0           |

#### 4. **Continue in Original Lane (\( T = 9 \) to \( T = 10 \))**:
   - Stay in the original lane (\( Y = 0 \)) while moving forward.

   | Time (s) | \( X \) (m) | \( Y \) (m) |
   |----------|-------------|-------------|
   | 10       | 200         | 0           |

### Summary:
The vehicle successfully bypasses the obstruction by transitioning to the adjacent lane, staying there until \( X > 100 \) meters, and then returning to the original lane. The speed remains above 60 km/h throughout the maneuver.
