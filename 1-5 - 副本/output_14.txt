To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the vehicle's movement into critical intervals, ensuring the speed remains above 60 km/h throughout. Here's the step-by-step plan:

### Key Parameters:
- **Initial Position (T = 0):** (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Obstruction Position:** (X, Y) = (100, 0)
- **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate:** Y = -5
- **Initial Velocity:** 72.0 km/h = 20 m/s
- **Minimum Speed:** 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s

### Assumptions:
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h).
2. Lane transitions are smooth and instantaneous for simplicity.
3. The obstruction is bypassed by moving into the adjacent lane (Y = -5) and returning to the original lane (Y = 0) after passing the obstruction.

### Critical Intervals and Positions:
1. **T = 0 s:**  
   Position: (0, 0)  
   Action: Begin traveling in the outer lane.

2. **T = 1 s:**  
   Position: (20, 0)  
   Action: Continue in the outer lane.

3. **T = 2 s:**  
   Position: (40, 0)  
   Action: Continue in the outer lane.

4. **T = 3 s:**  
   Position: (60, 0)  
   Action: Begin transitioning to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).

5. **T = 4 s:**  
   Position: (80, -5)  
   Action: Complete lane transition and continue in the adjacent lane.

6. **T = 5 s:**  
   Position: (100, -5)  
   Action: Bypass the obstruction in the adjacent lane.

7. **T = 6 s:**  
   Position: (120, -5)  
   Action: Continue in the adjacent lane.

8. **T = 7 s:**  
   Position: (140, -5)  
   Action: Begin transitioning back to the original lane (Y = 0).

9. **T = 8 s:**  
   Position: (160, 0)  
   Action: Complete lane transition and return to the original lane.

10. **T = 9 s:**  
    Position: (180, 0)  
    Action: Continue in the original lane.

11. **T = 10 s:**  
    Position: (200, 0)  
    Action: Continue in the original lane.

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) | Action                          |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          | Start in outer lane             |
| 1        | (20, 0)         | Continue in outer lane          |
| 2        | (40, 0)         | Continue in outer lane          |
| 3        | (60, 0)         | Begin lane transition           |
| 4        | (80, -5)        | Complete transition             |
| 5        | (100, -5)       | Bypass obstruction              |
| 6        | (120, -5)       | Continue in adjacent lane       |
| 7        | (140, -5)       | Begin return to original lane   |
| 8        | (160, 0)        | Complete return                 |
| 9        | (180, 0)        | Continue in original lane       |
| 10       | (200, 0)        | Continue in original lane       |

### Notes:
- The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
- Lane transitions are assumed to occur smoothly over a 1-second interval.
- The obstruction is bypassed safely by moving into the adjacent lane and returning to the original lane afterward.
