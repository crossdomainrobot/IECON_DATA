To navigate around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll plan a smooth lane transition, bypass the obstruction, and return to the original lane. Here¡¯s the step-by-step route plan:

### **Key Parameters**
1. **Initial Position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
2. **Obstruction Position**: (X, Y) = (100, 0)
3. **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5
4. **Initial Velocity**: 72.0 km/h = 20 m/s
5. **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s

---

### **Plan**
1. **Lane Transition**:
   - Smoothly move from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.
2. **Bypass Obstruction**:
   - Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until X > 100.
3. **Return to Original Lane**:
   - Smoothly move back from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.

### **Position Estimates**
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals, assuming constant speed (20 m/s) and smooth lane transitions.

| **Time (s)** | **X (m)** | **Y (m)** | **Description**                     |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| T = 0        | 0         | 0         | Starting position                   |
| T = 1        | 20        | -1.25     | Transitioning to adjacent lane      |
| T = 2        | 40        | -5        | Fully in adjacent lane              |
| T = 3        | 60        | -5        | Bypassing obstruction               |
| T = 4        | 80        | -5        | Bypassing obstruction               |
| T = 5        | 100       | -5        | At obstruction location             |
| T = 6        | 120       | -5        | Past obstruction                    |
| T = 7        | 140       | -3.75     | Transitioning back to original lane |
| T = 8        | 160       | 0         | Fully in original lane              |
| T = 9        | 180       | 0         | Continuing in original lane         |
| T = 10       | 200       | 0         | Continuing in original lane         |

### **Details**
1. **Lane Transition**:
   - Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds, using a linear change in Y:  
     Y = -5/2 * T for T = 0 to 2.
2. **Bypass Obstruction**:
   - Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) from T = 2 to T = 6.
3. **Return to Original Lane**:
   - Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds, using a linear change in Y:  
     Y = -5 + (5/2 * (T - 6)) for T = 6 to 8.

### **Speed Check**
- The vehicle¡¯s speed remains constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h), which exceeds the minimum requirement of 16.67 m/s (60 km/h).

This plan ensures a smooth and safe navigation around the obstruction while maintaining the required speed.
