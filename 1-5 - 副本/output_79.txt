To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we¨ll break the process into distinct phases: accelerating, lane change, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. We¨ll calculate the vehicle's position at 1-second intervals, ensuring the speed stays above 60 km/h.

### Key Assumptions:
1. **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h (20 m/s).
2. **Minimum Speed**: Must exceed 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).
3. **Lane Width**: Adjacent lane is at \( Y = -5 \).
4. **Obstruction**: Located at \( X = 100 \), \( Y = 0 \).
5. **Time Interval**: 1-second steps for 10 seconds.

### Steps:
1. **Accelerate (T = 0 to T = 2)**:
   - Increase speed slightly to ensure the lane change is smooth.
   - Assume acceleration to 75 km/h (20.83 m/s) over 2 seconds.

2. **Lane Change (T = 3 to T = 4)**:
   - Transition from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \) over 2 seconds.

3. **Bypass Obstruction (T = 5 to T = 7)**:
   - Continue in the adjacent lane (\( Y = -5 \)) until \( X > 100 \).

4. **Return to Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)**:
   - Transition back from \( Y = -5 \) to \( Y = 0 \) over 3 seconds.

### Position Estimates:
- **T = 0**: \( (0, 0) \) ！ Starting point.
- **T = 1**: \( (20, 0) \) ！ Moving at 20 m/s.
- **T = 2**: \( (40, 0) \) ！ Accelerating to 20.83 m/s.
- **T = 3**: \( (60, -1.25) \) ！ Begin lane change.
- **T = 4**: \( (80, -5) \) ！ Complete lane change.
- **T = 5**: \( (100, -5) \) ！ Reach obstruction location.
- **T = 6**: \( (120, -5) \) ！ Bypass obstruction.
- **T = 7**: \( (140, -5) \) ！ Continue in adjacent lane.
- **T = 8**: \( (160, -3.75) \) ！ Begin return to original lane.
- **T = 9**: \( (180, -1.25) \) ！ Continue returning.
- **T = 10**: \( (200, 0) \) ！ Complete return to original lane.

### Summary Table:
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)           |
| 1        | (20, 0)          |
| 2        | (40, 0)          |
| 3        | (60, -1.25)      |
| 4        | (80, -5)         |
| 5        | (100, -5)        |
| 6        | (120, -5)        |
| 7        | (140, -5)        |
| 8        | (160, -3.75)     |
| 9        | (180, -1.25)     |
| 10       | (200, 0)         |

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h and safely returns to the original lane.
