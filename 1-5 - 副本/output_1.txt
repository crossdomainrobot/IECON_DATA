To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we need to calculate the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. Here¡¯s the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Given:**
- **Starting position:** (X, Y) = (0, 0) at T = 0.
- **Obstruction:** Located at (100, 0).
- **Adjacent lane:** Y = -5.
- **Initial velocity:** 72.0 km/h = 20 m/s (converted to meters per second for calculations).
- **Minimum speed:** Must exceed 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s throughout.
2. Lane transitions are smooth and take 2 seconds each (1 second to move laterally and 1 second to stabilize).
3. The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane while bypassing the obstruction.

### **Route Planning:**

#### **1. Initial Movement (T = 0 to T = 2):**
   - **Objective:** Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
   - **Lateral movement:** Y changes linearly from 0 to -5 over 2 seconds.
   - **Longitudinal movement:** X increases at 20 m/s.

   | Time (s) | X (m)      | Y (m)  |
   |----------|------------|--------|
   | 0        | 0          | 0      |
   | 1        | 20         | -2.5   |
   | 2        | 40         | -5     |

---

#### **2. Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 7):**
   - **Objective:** Travel in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until the obstruction is bypassed.
   - **Longitudinal movement:** X increases at 20 m/s.

   | Time (s) | X (m)      | Y (m)  |
   |----------|------------|--------|
   | 3        | 60         | -5     |
   | 4        | 80         | -5     |
   | 5        | 100        | -5     |
   | 6        | 120        | -5     |
   | 7        | 140        | -5     |

---

#### **3. Returning to the Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 9):**
   - **Objective:** Transition from the adjacent lane (Y = -5) back to the outer lane (Y = 0).
   - **Lateral movement:** Y changes linearly from -5 to 0 over 2 seconds.
   - **Longitudinal movement:** X increases at 20 m/s.

   | Time (s) | X (m)      | Y (m)  |
   |----------|------------|--------|
   | 8        | 160        | -2.5   |
   | 9        | 180        | 0      |

---

#### **4. Continuing in the Original Lane (T = 9 to T = 10):**
   - **Objective:** Continue traveling in the outer lane (Y = 0).

   | Time (s) | X (m)      | Y (m)  |
   |----------|------------|--------|
   | 10       | 200        | 0      |

---

### **Summary of Positions:**

| Time (s) | X (m)      | Y (m)  |
|----------|------------|--------|
| 0        | 0          | 0      |
| 1        | 20         | -2.5   |
| 2        | 40         | -5     |
| 3        | 60         | -5     |
| 4        | 80         | -5     |
| 5        | 100        | -5     |
| 6        | 120        | -5     |
| 7        | 140        | -5     |
| 8        | 160        | -2.5   |
| 9        | 180        | 0      |
| 10       | 200        | 0      |

### **Key Points:**
- The vehicle successfully bypasses the obstruction at X = 100 while maintaining a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h).
- Lane transitions are completed smoothly within 2 seconds each.
- The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while bypassing the obstruction.
