To plan the route, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Transition (from Y = 0 to Y = -5)**: Move from the outer lane to the adjacent lane.
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**: Stay in the adjacent lane while passing the obstruction.
3. **Return to Original Lane (from Y = -5 to Y = 0)**: Move back to the outer lane.

### Assumptions:
- Initial velocity: \( 72.0 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \).
- Maintain speed above \( 60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \).
- Obstruction is at \( X = 100 \, \text{m} \).
- Lane width: \( Y = -5 \, \text{m} \) (adjacent lane).

### Phase 1: Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)
- Duration: 2 seconds (assume smooth lateral movement).
- Lateral movement: From \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \) at a constant rate.
- Longitudinal movement: \( X = v \cdot T = 20 \, \text{m/s} \cdot T \).

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 8 seconds)
- Duration: 6 seconds (to ensure the obstruction is fully bypassed).
- Lateral position: \( Y = -5 \) (remain in the adjacent lane).
- Longitudinal movement: \( X = v \cdot T = 20 \, \text{m/s} \cdot T \).

### Phase 3: Return to Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds)
- Duration: 2 seconds (smooth lateral movement back).
- Lateral movement: From \( Y = -5 \) to \( Y = 0 \) at a constant rate.
- Longitudinal movement: \( X = v \cdot T = 20 \, \text{m/s} \cdot T \).

### Route Planning:
Here¡¯s the vehicle¡¯s position at critical intervals:

| Time (T) | X (m)       | Y (m)       | Phase                     |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| 0        | 0           | 0           | Start                     |
| 1        | 20          | -2.5        | Transitioning to adjacent lane |
| 2        | 40          | -5          | Fully in adjacent lane    |
| 3        | 60          | -5          | Bypassing obstruction     |
| 4        | 80          | -5          | Bypassing obstruction     |
| 5        | 100         | -5          | Passing obstruction       |
| 6        | 120         | -5          | Bypassing obstruction     |
| 7        | 140         | -5          | Bypassing obstruction     |
| 8        | 160         | -5          | Preparing to return       |
| 9        | 180         | -2.5        | Transitioning back        |
| 10       | 200         | 0           | Fully in original lane    |

### Key Points:
- The vehicle maintains a speed of \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \) throughout.
- The obstruction is bypassed safely by staying in the adjacent lane from \( T = 2 \) to \( T = 8 \).
- The maneuver is completed in 10 seconds.
