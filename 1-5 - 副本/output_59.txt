To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break the movement into critical phases: acceleration, lane transition, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. Here¡¯s the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Given:**
- Starting position: \((X, Y) = (0, 0)\)
- Obstruction: \((X, Y) = (100, 0)\)
- Adjacent lane: \(Y = -5\)
- Initial velocity: \(72.0 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s}\)
- Minimum speed: \(60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s}\)

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. **Lane Transition:** The lane change is smooth and takes 2 seconds to complete.
2. **Speed:** The vehicle maintains a constant speed of \(20 \, \text{m/s}\) throughout the maneuver.
3. **Time Steps:** Positions are calculated at 1-second intervals.

---

### **Route Plan:**

#### **Phase 1: Initial Movement (T = 0 to T = 3)**
- **T = 0:** \((X, Y) = (0, 0)\)
- **T = 1:** \((X, Y) = (20, 0)\)
- **T = 2:** \((X, Y) = (40, 0)\)
- **T = 3:** \((X, Y) = (60, 0)\)

#### **Phase 2: Lane Transition (T = 3 to T = 5)**
- The vehicle starts transitioning to the adjacent lane (\(Y = -5\)) at \(T = 3\) and completes the transition by \(T = 5\).
- **T = 4:** \((X, Y) = (80, -2.5)\)
- **T = 5:** \((X, Y) = (100, -5)\)

#### **Phase 3: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 5 to T = 7)**
- The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (\(Y = -5\)) while bypassing the obstruction.
- **T = 6:** \((X, Y) = (120, -5)\)
- **T = 7:** \((X, Y) = (140, -5)\)

#### **Phase 4: Returning to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 9)**
- The vehicle starts transitioning back to the original lane (\(Y = 0\)) at \(T = 7\) and completes the transition by \(T = 9\).
- **T = 8:** \((X, Y) = (160, -2.5)\)
- **T = 9:** \((X, Y) = (180, 0)\)

#### **Phase 5: Continuing in Original Lane (T = 9 to T = 10)**
- The vehicle continues moving in the original lane.
- **T = 10:** \((X, Y) = (200, 0)\)

### **Summary of Positions:**
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y)  |
|----------|------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)           |
| 1        | (20, 0)          |
| 2        | (40, 0)          |
| 3        | (60, 0)          |
| 4        | (80, -2.5)       |
| 5        | (100, -5)        |
| 6        | (120, -5)        |
| 7        | (140, -5)        |
| 8        | (160, -2.5)      |
| 9        | (180, 0)         |
| 10       | (200, 0)         |

---

### **Key Points:**
1. The vehicle maintains a speed of \(20 \, \text{m/s}\) throughout.
2. The lane transitions are smooth and completed within 2 seconds each.
3. The obstruction at \((100, 0)\) is bypassed safely by staying in the adjacent lane from \(T = 3\) to \(T = 7\).
