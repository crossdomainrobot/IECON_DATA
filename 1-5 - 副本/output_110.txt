To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100, Y = -5)**  
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**  

Here¡¯s the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Given:**
- **Initial Position:** (X, Y) = (0, 0)  
- **Obstruction Position:** (X, Y) = (100, 0)  
- **Adjacent Lane Position:** Y = -5  
- **Initial Velocity:** 72.0 km/h = 20 m/s  
- **Minimum Speed:** 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s  

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.  
2. The lane change takes approximately 2 seconds (1 second to transition into the adjacent lane and 1 second to transition back).  
3. The vehicle travels in a straight line in each lane.

### **Route Plan:**

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
- **Time:** T = 0 to T = 1 second  
- **Movement:** Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5.  
- **Positions:**  
  - T = 0: (0, 0)  
  - T = 1: (20, -5)  

---

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (Y = -5)**  
- **Time:** T = 1 to T = 6 seconds  
- **Movement:** Travel in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until the obstruction is bypassed (X = 100).  
- **Positions:**  
  - T = 2: (40, -5)  
  - T = 3: (60, -5)  
  - T = 4: (80, -5)  
  - T = 5: (100, -5)  
  - T = 6: (120, -5)  

---

#### **Phase 3: Lane Change Back to Original Lane (Y = 0)**  
- **Time:** T = 6 to T = 7 seconds  
- **Movement:** Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0.  
- **Positions:**  
  - T = 7: (140, 0)  

---

### **Final Route Summary:**
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) | Phase Description               |  
|----------|-----------------|---------------------------------|  
| 0        | (0, 0)          | Start                           |  
| 1        | (20, -5)        | Lane change to adjacent lane    |  
| 2        | (40, -5)        | Bypassing obstruction           |  
| 3        | (60, -5)        | Bypassing obstruction           |  
| 4        | (80, -5)        | Bypassing obstruction           |  
| 5        | (100, -5)       | Bypassing obstruction           |  
| 6        | (120, -5)       | Bypassing obstruction           |  
| 7        | (140, 0)        | Lane change back to original lane |  

---

### **Key Points:**
- The vehicle successfully bypasses the obstruction by transitioning to the adjacent lane and returning to the original lane.  
- The speed remains constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h), ensuring compliance with the minimum speed requirement.  
- The maneuver is completed within 7 seconds.
