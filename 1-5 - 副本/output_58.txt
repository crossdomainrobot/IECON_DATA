To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we need to consider the vehicle¡¯s movement in both the longitudinal (X) and lateral (Y) directions. Here¡¯s a step-by-step breakdown of the vehicle¡¯s position at critical intervals over the next 10 seconds:

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. **Initial Position:** (X, Y) = (0, 0)
2. **Obstruction Position:** (X, Y) = (100, 0)
3. **Adjacent Lane:** Y = -5
4. **Initial Velocity:** 72.0 km/h (20 m/s)
5. **Minimum Speed:** Must exceed 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)

---

### **Steps:**
1. **Lane Change to Adjacent Lane:**
   - Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over a short period (e.g., 2 seconds).
   - Maintain speed during the lane change.

2. **Bypass the Obstruction:**
   - Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until the vehicle passes X = 100.

3. **Return to Original Lane:**
   - Transition from Y = -5 back to Y = 0 over another short period (e.g., 2 seconds).

### **Position Estimates:**
We calculate the vehicle¡¯s position every second, assuming constant speed of 20 m/s in the X-direction and smooth lateral transitions.

#### **T = 0s:**
- Position: (0, 0)

#### **T = 1s:**
- X = 0 + (20 m/s ¡Á 1s) = 20 m
- Y = 0 (starting lane change)
- Position: (20, 0)

#### **T = 2s:**
- X = 20 + (20 ¡Á 1) = 40 m
- Y = -2.5 (midway in lane change)
- Position: (40, -2.5)

#### **T = 3s:**
- X = 40 + (20 ¡Á 1) = 60 m
- Y = -5 (fully in adjacent lane)
- Position: (60, -5)

#### **T = 4s:**
- X = 60 + (20 ¡Á 1) = 80 m
- Y = -5 (bypassing obstruction)
- Position: (80, -5)

#### **T = 5s:**
- X = 80 + (20 ¡Á 1) = 100 m
- Y = -5 (passing obstruction)
- Position: (100, -5)

#### **T = 6s:**
- X = 100 + (20 ¡Á 1) = 120 m
- Y = -5 (still in adjacent lane)
- Position: (120, -5)

#### **T = 7s:**
- X = 120 + (20 ¡Á 1) = 140 m
- Y = -2.5 (starting return to original lane)
- Position: (140, -2.5)

#### **T = 8s:**
- X = 140 + (20 ¡Á 1) = 160 m
- Y = 0 (fully in original lane)
- Position: (160, 0)

#### **T = 9s:**
- X = 160 + (20 ¡Á 1) = 180 m
- Y = 0 (continuing in original lane)
- Position: (180, 0)

#### **T = 10s:**
- X = 180 + (20 ¡Á 1) = 200 m
- Y = 0 (continuing in original lane)
- Position: (200, 0)

### **Summary of Positions:**
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|-----------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, 0)         |
| 2        | (40, -2.5)      |
| 3        | (60, -5)        |
| 4        | (80, -5)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -5)       |
| 7        | (140, -2.5)     |
| 8        | (160, 0)        |
| 9        | (180, 0)        |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

This plan ensures the vehicle navigates around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h and smoothly transitions between lanes.
