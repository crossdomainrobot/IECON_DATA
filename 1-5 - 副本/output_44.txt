To construct a route plan that allows your vehicle to bypass the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we'll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane**: Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction**: Travel past the obstruction located at (X = 100) while staying in the adjacent lane.
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane**: Transition from the adjacent lane (Y = -5) back to the outer lane (Y = 0).

### Assumptions:
- **Initial Velocity**: 72.0 km/h (20 m/s).
- **Lane Width**: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).
- **Obstruction Location**: (X = 100, Y = 0).
- **Time Intervals**: 1-second increments.

### Route Planning:

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)**
- **T = 0 s**: Starting position (0, 0).
- **T = 1 s**: Vehicle moves forward 20 meters, begins lateral movement toward the adjacent lane. Position: (20, -1.25).
- **T = 2 s**: Vehicle completes the lane change. Position: (40, -5).

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6 seconds)**
- **T = 3 s**: Vehicle continues straight in the adjacent lane. Position: (60, -5).
- **T = 4 s**: Vehicle approaches the obstruction. Position: (80, -5).
- **T = 5 s**: Vehicle bypasses the obstruction. Position: (100, -5).
- **T = 6 s**: Vehicle continues past the obstruction. Position: (120, -5).

#### **Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)**
- **T = 7 s**: Vehicle begins lateral movement back to the outer lane. Position: (140, -3.75).
- **T = 8 s**: Vehicle completes the lane change. Position: (160, 0).

#### **Phase 4: Continuing in the Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds)**
- **T = 9 s**: Vehicle continues straight in the outer lane. Position: (180, 0).
- **T = 10 s**: Vehicle continues straight in the outer lane. Position: (200, 0).

### Summary of Positions:
- **T = 0 s**: (0, 0)
- **T = 1 s**: (20, -1.25)
- **T = 2 s**: (40, -5)
- **T = 3 s**: (60, -5)
- **T = 4 s**: (80, -5)
- **T = 5 s**: (100, -5)
- **T = 6 s**: (120, -5)
- **T = 7 s**: (140, -3.75)
- **T = 8 s**: (160, 0)
- **T = 9 s**: (180, 0)
- **T = 10 s**: (200, 0)

### Notes:
- The lane change is assumed to take 2 seconds, with a smooth lateral transition.
- The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
- The obstruction is bypassed safely by staying in the adjacent lane until the vehicle is clear of it.

This plan ensures that the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h and safely navigates around the obstruction.
