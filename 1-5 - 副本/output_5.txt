To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the process into phases:

### **Phase 1: Travel in the Outer Lane (Y = 0)**
- **Initial Position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Velocity**: 72.0 km/h = 20 m/s (converted for ease of calculation)
- **Time Interval**: T = 0 to T = 4 seconds
- **Distance Covered**: X = Velocity ¡Á Time = 20 m/s ¡Á T

### **Phase 2: Transition to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**
- **Time Interval**: T = 4 to T = 6 seconds
- **Lateral Movement**: Assume a smooth transition over 2 seconds, moving laterally at a constant rate of 2.5 m/s.

### **Phase 3: Bypass the Obstruction in the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**
- **Time Interval**: T = 6 to T = 8 seconds
- **Distance Covered**: X = 20 m/s ¡Á T

### **Phase 4: Transition Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**
- **Time Interval**: T = 8 to T = 10 seconds
- **Lateral Movement**: Assume a smooth transition over 2 seconds, moving laterally at a constant rate of 2.5 m/s.

| 8        | 160          | -5                    | Prepare to return to the original lane |
| 9        | 180          | -2.5                  | Transitioning back to the outer lane   |
| 10       | 200          | 0                     | Fully in the outer lane                |

### **Key Points**
1. **Speed**: Maintained at 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout, exceeding the minimum requirement of 60 km/h.
2. **Obstruction Bypassed**: The obstruction at X = 100 is bypassed while in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
3. **Smooth Transitions**: Lane changes are completed over 2 seconds each, ensuring safety and stability.

This plan ensures the vehicle navigates around the obstruction efficiently while adhering to speed and safety constraints.
