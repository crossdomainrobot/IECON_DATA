To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we'll break the process into phases: transitioning to the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction, and transitioning back to the original lane. We'll estimate the vehicle's position at 1-second intervals.

### **Given Data**
- Initial position: \( (X, Y) = (0, 0) \)
- Obstruction: \( (100, 0) \)
- Adjacent lane: \( Y = -5 \)
- Initial velocity: \( 72.0 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \)
- Speed constraint: \( > 60 \, \text{km/h} \) (\( \approx 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \))

---

### **Assumptions**
1. The lane transition takes **2 seconds** (smooth lateral movement).
2. The bypassing phase takes **3 seconds** (traveling past the obstruction in the adjacent lane).
3. The return transition takes **2 seconds** (smooth lateral movement back to the original lane).
4. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \) throughout.

### **Route Plan**
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at \( T = 0, 1, 2, \dots, 10 \) seconds.

#### **Phase 1: Transition to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2)**
- Lateral movement: From \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \) over 2 seconds.
- \( Y \) changes linearly: \( Y = -2.5 \times T \).
- \( X \) increases linearly: \( X = 20 \times T \).

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 5)**
- Lateral position: \( Y = -5 \) (constant).
- \( X \) increases linearly: \( X = 20 \times T \).

#### **Phase 3: Transition Back to Original Lane (T = 5 to T = 7)**
- Lateral movement: From \( Y = -5 \) to \( Y = 0 \) over 2 seconds.
- \( Y \) changes linearly: \( Y = -5 + 2.5 \times (T - 5) \).
- \( X \) increases linearly: \( X = 20 \times T \).

#### **Phase 4: Continue in Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10)**
- Lateral position: \( Y = 0 \) (constant).
- \( X \) increases linearly: \( X = 20 \times T \).

### **Position Estimates**
| Time (s) | \( X \) (m) | \( Y \) (m) | Description                             |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 0        | 0           | 0           | Starting position                       |
| 1        | 20          | -2.5        | Transitioning to adjacent lane          |
| 2        | 40          | -5          | Fully in adjacent lane                  |
| 3        | 60          | -5          | Bypassing obstruction                   |
| 4        | 80          | -5          | Bypassing obstruction                   |
| 5        | 100         | -5          | Obstruction bypassed                    |
| 6        | 120         | -2.5        | Transitioning back to original lane     |
| 7        | 140         | 0           | Fully back in original lane             |
| 8        | 160         | 0           | Continuing in original lane             |
| 9        | 180         | 0           | Continuing in original lane             |
| 10       | 200         | 0           | Continuing in original lane             |

### **Summary**
- The vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane by \( T = 2 \) seconds.
- It bypasses the obstruction at \( T = 5 \) seconds.
- It transitions back to the original lane by \( T = 7 \) seconds.
- The vehicle maintains a speed of \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \) (\( 72 \, \text{km/h} \)) throughout, satisfying the speed constraint.
