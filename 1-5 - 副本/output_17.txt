To navigate around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we need to plan the lane transition carefully. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the vehicle's position at critical intervals over the next 10 seconds:

### Given:
- **Initial position**: \( (X, Y) = (0.0, 0) \)
- **Obstruction position**: \( (100, 0) \)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate**: \( Y = -5 \) (assuming negative Y is the adjacent lane)
- **Initial velocity**: \( 72.0 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \)
- **Minimum speed**: \( 60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \)

### Assumptions:
1. The vehicle accelerates/decelerates smoothly.
2. The lane change is completed within 3 seconds.
3. The vehicle maintains a speed above 16.67 m/s throughout.

### Step 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)
- **Time interval**: 0 to 3 seconds
- **Lane change duration**: 3 seconds
- **Lateral movement**: From \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \)
- **Lateral velocity**: \( \frac{-5 \, \text{m}}{3 \, \text{s}} \approx -1.67 \, \text{m/s} \)

### Step 2: Bypass the Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7 seconds)
- **Time interval**: 3 to 7 seconds
- **Lateral position**: \( Y = -5 \) (adjacent lane)
- **Speed**: Maintain \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \)

### Step 3: Lane Change Back (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds)
- **Time interval**: 7 to 10 seconds
- **Lane change duration**: 3 seconds
- **Lateral movement**: From \( Y = -5 \) to \( Y = 0 \)
- **Lateral velocity**: \( \frac{5 \, \text{m}}{3 \, \text{s}} \approx 1.67 \, \text{m/s} \)

### Vehicle's Position at Critical Intervals:

| Time (s) | X (m)        | Y (m)        | Description                     |
|----------|--------------|--------------|---------------------------------|
| 0        | 0.0          | 0.0          | Starting position               |
| 1        | 20.0         | -1.67        | Lane change in progress         |
| 2        | 40.0         | -3.33        | Lane change in progress         |
| 3        | 60.0         | -5.0         | Fully in adjacent lane          |
| 4        | 80.0         | -5.0         | Bypassing obstruction           |
| 5        | 100.0        | -5.0         | Passing the obstruction         |
| 6        | 120.0        | -5.0         | Bypassing obstruction           |
| 7        | 140.0        | -5.0         | Starting lane change back       |
| 8        | 160.0        | -3.33        | Lane change back in progress    |
| 9        | 180.0        | -1.67        | Lane change back in progress    |
| 10       | 200.0        | 0.0          | Back in the original lane       |

### Summary:
- **Lane change**: Completed by \( T = 3 \) seconds.
- **Bypass**: Completed by \( T = 7 \) seconds.
- **Lane change back**: Completed by \( T = 10 \) seconds.

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h while safely navigating around the obstruction and returning to the original lane.
