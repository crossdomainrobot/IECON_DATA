To plan the route for your vehicle, we'll break down the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**

### Assumptions:
- **Initial Position**: (0, 0)
- **Obstruction Position**: (100, 0)
- **Adjacent Lane**: Y = -5
- **Speed**: 72 km/h (20 m/s, since 72 km/h = 20 m/s)
- **Time Interval**: 1 second
- **Total Time**: 10 seconds

### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)
- **Time**: T = 0 to T = 2 seconds
- **Duration**: 2 seconds
- **Lateral Movement**: From Y = 0 to Y = -5
- **Lateral Speed**: 2.5 m/s (since 5 meters / 2 seconds = 2.5 m/s)
- **Longitudinal Movement**: X increases at 20 m/s

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)
- **Time**: T = 2 to T = 6 seconds
- **Duration**: 4 seconds
- **Lateral Position**: Y = -5 (stay in the adjacent lane)
- **Longitudinal Movement**: X increases at 20 m/s

### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)
- **Time**: T = 6 to T = 8 seconds
- **Duration**: 2 seconds
- **Lateral Movement**: From Y = -5 to Y = 0
- **Lateral Speed**: 2.5 m/s
- **Longitudinal Movement**: X increases at 20 m/s

### Position Estimates:

- **T = 0 seconds**: (0, 0)
- **T = 1 second**: (20, -2.5)
- **T = 2 seconds**: (40, -5)
- **T = 3 seconds**: (60, -5)
- **T = 4 seconds**: (80, -5)
- **T = 5 seconds**: (100, -5)
- **T = 6 seconds**: (120, -5)
- **T = 7 seconds**: (140, -2.5)
- **T = 8 seconds**: (160, 0)
- **T = 9 seconds**: (180, 0)
- **T = 10 seconds**: (200, 0)

### Summary:
- **Lane Change to Adjacent Lane**: Completed by T = 2 seconds
- **Bypassing the Obstruction**: Completed by T = 5 seconds
- **Lane Change Back to Original Lane**: Completed by T = 8 seconds
- **Final Position at T = 10 seconds**: (200, 0)

This plan ensures that you bypass the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h throughout the maneuver.
