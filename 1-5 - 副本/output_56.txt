To plan the route and estimate the vehicle¡¯s position at critical intervals, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into phases: **lane change**, **bypassing the obstruction**, and **returning to the original lane**. Here¡¯s the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Given Parameters:**
- **Starting position:** (0.0, 0.0)
- **Obstruction position:** (100, 0.0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate:** Y = -5
- **Initial velocity:** 72.0 km/h = 20 m/s (converted for ease of calculation)
- **Minimum speed:** 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The lane change takes **3 seconds** (a smooth, safe transition).
2. The bypass phase lasts until the vehicle passes the obstruction (X = 100).
3. The return to the original lane takes **3 seconds** after bypassing the obstruction.

---

### **Step 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 3)**
- **X-coordinate:** Increases linearly with time. \( X = 20 \cdot T \)
- **Y-coordinate:** Transitions from 0 to -5 over 3 seconds. \( Y = -\frac{5}{3} \cdot T \)

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 1        | 20    | -1.67 |
| 2        | 40    | -3.33 |
| 3        | 60    | -5.00 |

---

### **Step 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 5)**
- **X-coordinate:** Continues to increase linearly. \( X = 20 \cdot T \)
- **Y-coordinate:** Remains at -5 (stays in the adjacent lane).

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 4        | 80    | -5.00 |
| 5        | 100   | -5.00 |

---

### **Step 3: Returning to the Original Lane (T = 5 to T = 8)**
- **X-coordinate:** Continues to increase linearly. \( X = 20 \cdot T \)
- **Y-coordinate:** Transitions from -5 to 0 over 3 seconds. \( Y = -5 + \frac{5}{3} \cdot (T - 5) \)

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 6        | 120   | -3.33 |
| 7        | 140   | -1.67 |
| 8        | 160   | 0.00  |

---

### **Summary of Positions:**

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 1        | 20    | -1.67 |
| 2        | 40    | -3.33 |
| 3        | 60    | -5.00 |
| 4        | 80    | -5.00 |
| 5        | 100   | -5.00 |
| 6        | 120   | -3.33 |
| 7        | 140   | -1.67 |
| 8        | 160   | 0.00  |

### **Key Notes:**
- The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver, satisfying the minimum speed requirement.
- The lane change and return are smooth and completed within 3 seconds each.
- The obstruction at (100, 0) is successfully bypassed by staying in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) from T = 3 to T = 5.
