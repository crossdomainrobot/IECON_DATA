To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the vehicle's movement into critical intervals. We'll calculate its position (X, Y) at each second (T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10) while ensuring the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h and completes the lane transitions smoothly.

### Key Assumptions:
1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - Starting position: \( (X, Y) = (0, 0) \).
   - Obstruction position: \( (X, Y) = (100, 0) \).
   - Adjacent lane¡¯s Y-coordinate: \( Y = -5 \).
   - Initial speed: \( 72.0 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \).

2. **Constraints**:
   - Speed must remain above \( 60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \).
   - Lane transitions must be smooth and safe.

3. **Route Plan**:
   - Transition to the adjacent lane \( (Y = -5) \) before reaching the obstruction.
   - Bypass the obstruction at \( X = 100 \) while staying in the adjacent lane.
   - Transition back to the original lane \( (Y = 0) \) after passing the obstruction.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

#### 1. **Lane Transition to Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**:
   - Assume the lane transition takes **2 seconds**.
   - Lateral velocity: \( \Delta Y = -5 \, \text{m} / 2 \, \text{s} = -2.5 \, \text{m/s} \).
   - During these 2 seconds, the vehicle continues moving forward at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).

   | Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
   |----------|-------|-------|
   | 0        | 0     | 0     |
   | 1        | 20    | -2.5  |
   | 2        | 40    | -5    |

#### 2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**:
   - From \( T = 2 \) to \( T = 5 \), the vehicle remains in the adjacent lane \( (Y = -5) \) and moves forward.
   - Distance to bypass the obstruction: \( 100 \, \text{m} - 40 \, \text{m} = 60 \, \text{m} \).
   - Time to bypass: \( 60 \, \text{m} / 20 \, \text{m/s} = 3 \, \text{s} \).

   | Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
   |----------|-------|-------|
   | 3        | 60    | -5    |
   | 4        | 80    | -5    |
   | 5        | 100   | -5    |

#### 3. **Lane Transition Back to Original Lane (Y = 0)**:
   - Assume the lane transition takes **2 seconds**.
   - Lateral velocity: \( \Delta Y = 5 \, \text{m} / 2 \, \text{s} = 2.5 \, \text{m/s} \).
   - During these 2 seconds, the vehicle continues moving forward at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).

   | Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
   |----------|-------|-------|
   | 6        | 120   | -2.5  |
   | 7        | 140   | 0     |

#### 4. **Continue in Original Lane (Y = 0)**:
   - From \( T = 7 \) to \( T = 10 \), the vehicle remains in the original lane and moves forward.

   | Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
   |----------|-------|-------|
   | 8        | 160   | 0     |
   | 9        | 180   | 0     |
   | 10       | 200   | 0     |

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |
| 2        | 40    | -5    |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -2.5  |
| 7        | 140   | 0     |
| 8        | 160   | 0     |
| 9        | 180   | 0     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### Notes:
- The vehicle maintains a speed of \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \) throughout, which satisfies the constraint of exceeding \( 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \).
- The lane transitions are smooth and completed within the specified time frame.
