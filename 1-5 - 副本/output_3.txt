To plan the lane transition and bypass the obstruction, we'll break down the vehicle's movement into critical intervals. The vehicle starts at (0, 0) with an initial velocity of **72 km/h (20 m/s)**. We'll ensure the speed remains above **60 km/h (16.67 m/s)** throughout the maneuver. The adjacent lane is at **Y = -5**, and the obstruction is at **X = 100**. We'll calculate the vehicle's position at **1-second intervals** for **10 seconds**.

### Assumptions:
1. **Lane change duration**: Assume it takes **3 seconds** to transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) and another **3 seconds** to return.
2. **Lateral velocity during lane change**: The lateral movement is uniform, so the vehicle moves **-5/3 ¡Ö -1.67 m/s** laterally during the lane change.
3. **Longitudinal velocity**: The vehicle maintains a constant speed of **20 m/s** (72 km/h) in the X-direction.

### Route Planning:

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 3)**
- **Lateral movement**: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 at a rate of -1.67 m/s.
- **Longitudinal movement**: Move forward at 20 m/s.

At each second:
- **T = 1**: X = 20, Y = -1.67
- **T = 2**: X = 40, Y = -3.33
- **T = 3**: X = 60, Y = -5

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7)**
- **Lateral position**: Remain in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
- **Longitudinal movement**: Continue at 20 m/s.

At each second:
- **T = 4**: X = 80, Y = -5
- **T = 5**: X = 100, Y = -5 (bypass the obstruction)
- **T = 6**: X = 120, Y = -5
- **T = 7**: X = 140, Y = -5

#### **Phase 3: Lane Change Back (T = 7 to T = 10)**
- **Lateral movement**: Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 at a rate of 1.67 m/s.
- **Longitudinal movement**: Continue at 20 m/s.

At each second:
- **T = 8**: X = 160, Y = -3.33
- **T = 9**: X = 180, Y = -1.67
- **T = 10**: X = 200, Y = 0

### Key Points:
1. The vehicle bypasses the obstruction at **T = 5**, remaining in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
2. The lane change is smooth and completed within **10 seconds**.
3. The vehicle's speed remains above **60 km/h** throughout the maneuver.
