To plan the route and estimate the vehicle¡¯s position at critical intervals, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:  
1. **Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypass the obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Return to the original lane (Y = 0)**  

### Key Assumptions:  
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s  
- Obstruction at (100, 0)  
- Adjacent lane: Y = -5  
- Time step: 1 second  

### Calculations:  
1. **Time to reach the obstruction**:  
   Distance to obstruction = 100 m  
   Speed = 20 m/s  
   Time = 100 / 20 = 5 seconds  

2. **Lane Transition**:  
   Assume the lane change takes 2 seconds (smooth transition).  
   - Start transitioning at T = 1 second.  
   - Complete transition by T = 3 second.  

3. **Bypass the obstruction**:  
   Remain in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until X > 100.  

4. **Return to the original lane**:  
   Start transitioning back at T = 6 second.  
   Complete transition by T = 8 second.  

### Position Estimates:  
| Time (T) | X (m)       | Y (m)       | Description                          |  
|----------|-------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|  
| 0        | 0.0         | 0.0         | Starting position                    |  
| 1        | 20          | 0.0         | Begin lane transition                |  
| 2        | 40          | -2.5        | Midway through lane transition       |  
| 3        | 60          | -5.0        | Fully in adjacent lane               |  
| 4        | 80          | -5.0        | Approaching obstruction              |  
| 5        | 100         | -5.0        | At obstruction, bypassing it         |  
| 6        | 120         | -5.0        | Begin return to original lane        |  
| 7        | 140         | -2.5        | Midway through return transition     |  
| 8        | 160         | 0.0         | Fully back in original lane          |  
| 9        | 180         | 0.0         | Continue in original lane            |  
| 10       | 200         | 0.0         | Continue in original lane            |  

### Summary:  
- The vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane between T = 1 and T = 3.  
- It bypasses the obstruction at T = 5 while remaining in the adjacent lane.  
- It transitions back to the original lane between T = 6 and T = 8.  
- The speed remains above 60 km/h throughout the maneuver.  

This plan ensures smooth navigation around the obstruction while maintaining safe speed and lane discipline.
