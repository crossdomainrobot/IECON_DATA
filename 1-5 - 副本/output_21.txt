To navigate around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we need to plan the lane transition, bypass, and return to the original lane. Here＊s a step-by-step plan with estimated positions at critical time intervals:

### Assumptions:
1. **Initial Position**: (0, 0) at \( T = 0 \).
2. **Obstruction Position**: (100, 0).
3. **Adjacent Lane**: \( Y = -5 \).
4. **Initial Speed**: 72 km/h (20 m/s).
5. **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).
6. **Time Intervals**: 1-second increments.

### Steps:
1. **Lane Transition**: Move from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \) over 2 seconds.
2. **Bypass Obstruction**: Stay in the adjacent lane (\( Y = -5 \)) until \( X > 100 \).
3. **Return to Original Lane**: Move from \( Y = -5 \) back to \( Y = 0 \) over 2 seconds.

### Calculations:
- **Distance Traveled Per Second**: At 20 m/s, the vehicle travels 20 meters each second.
- **Lane Transition**: Smoothly transition over 2 seconds, changing \( Y \) by -2.5 meters each second.
- **Bypass Obstruction**: Stay in the adjacent lane until \( X > 100 \).
- **Return to Original Lane**: Smoothly transition over 2 seconds, changing \( Y \) by +2.5 meters each second.

### Position Estimates:
Here＊s the vehicle＊s position \((X, Y)\) at each second:

- **\( T = 0 \)**: (0, 0) 每 Starting point.
- **\( T = 1 \)**: (20, -2.5) 每 Transitioning to the adjacent lane.
- **\( T = 2 \)**: (40, -5) 每 Fully in the adjacent lane.
- **\( T = 3 \)**: (60, -5) 每 Bypassing the obstruction.
- **\( T = 4 \)**: (80, -5) 每 Bypassing the obstruction.
- **\( T = 5 \)**: (100, -5) 每 Reaching the obstruction＊s location.
- **\( T = 6 \)**: (120, -5) 每 Fully bypassed the obstruction.
- **\( T = 7 \)**: (140, -2.5) 每 Transitioning back to the original lane.
- **\( T = 8 \)**: (160, 0) 每 Fully back in the original lane.
- **\( T = 9 \)**: (180, 0) 每 Continuing in the original lane.
- **\( T = 10 \)**: (200, 0) 每 Continuing in the original lane.

### Summary:
- **Lane Transition**: Completed by \( T = 2 \).
- **Bypass Obstruction**: Completed by \( T = 6 \).
- **Return to Original Lane**: Completed by \( T = 8 \).
- **Speed**: Maintained above 60 km/h throughout.

This plan ensures the vehicle safely navigates around the obstruction while adhering to the speed constraint.
