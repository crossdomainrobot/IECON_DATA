To construct a route planning for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed exceeding 60 km/h, we will break down the maneuver into critical intervals. Here¡¯s a step-by-step plan:

---

### **Assumptions and Conversions**
1. **Initial Velocity**: \( 72.0 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \).
2. **Minimum Speed Constraint**: \( 60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \).
3. **Obstruction Location**: \( (X = 100, Y = 0) \).
4. **Adjacent Lane**: \( Y = -5 \).

---

### **Steps**
1. **Lane Transition (Outer Lane to Adjacent Lane)**:
   - Begin transitioning to the adjacent lane at \( T = 0 \).
   - Complete the transition smoothly by \( T = 2 \) seconds.
   - Maintain a constant speed of \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).

2. **Bypassing the Obstruction**:
   - Stay in the adjacent lane (\( Y = -5 \)) while passing the obstruction at \( X = 100 \).
   - Ensure the vehicle is fully in the adjacent lane by \( X = 100 \).

3. **Lane Transition (Adjacent Lane to Outer Lane)**:
   - Begin transitioning back to the outer lane after passing the obstruction.
   - Complete the transition by \( T = 8 \) seconds.

### **Position Estimates**
Using \( X(t) = X_0 + v \cdot t \) and \( Y(t) \) for lateral movement:

| Time (s) | \( X(t) \) (m) | \( Y(t) \) (m) | Description |
|----------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| \( T = 0 \) | \( 0.0 \) | \( 0.0 \) | Starting point. |
| \( T = 1 \) | \( 20.0 \) | \( -2.5 \) | Transitioning to adjacent lane. |
| \( T = 2 \) | \( 40.0 \) | \( -5.0 \) | Fully in adjacent lane. |
| \( T = 3 \) | \( 60.0 \) | \( -5.0 \) | Bypassing obstruction. |
| \( T = 4 \) | \( 80.0 \) | \( -5.0 \) | Bypassing obstruction. |
| \( T = 5 \) | \( 100.0 \) | \( -5.0 \) | Passing obstruction. |
| \( T = 6 \) | \( 120.0 \) | \( -3.75 \) | Transitioning back to outer lane. |
| \( T = 7 \) | \( 140.0 \) | \( -1.25 \) | Transitioning back to outer lane. |
| \( T = 8 \) | \( 160.0 \) | \( 0.0 \) | Fully back in outer lane. |
| \( T = 9 \) | \( 180.0 \) | \( 0.0 \) | Continuing in outer lane. |
| \( T = 10 \) | \( 200.0 \) | \( 0.0 \) | Continuing in outer lane. |

---

### **Key Points**
- The vehicle maintains a constant speed of \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \) throughout.
- The lane transitions are smooth and take 2 seconds each.
- The obstruction is bypassed safely in the adjacent lane.
