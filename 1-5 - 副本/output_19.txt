To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we need to break down the maneuver into key steps and estimate the vehicle¡¯s position at critical time intervals. Here¡¯s the plan:

---

### **Assumptions and Initial Conditions**
1. **Starting Position**: (0.0, 0) at \( T = 0 \).
2. **Obstruction Position**: (100, 0).
3. **Adjacent Lane**: \( Y = -5 \).
4. **Initial Velocity**: 72.0 km/h = 20 m/s.
5. **Minimum Speed Constraint**: Must exceed 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.
6. **Time Frame**: 10 seconds.

---

### **Key Steps**
1. **Lane Change to Adjacent Lane**:
   - Transition from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \) smoothly.
   - Assume this takes 2 seconds.

2. **Bypass the Obstruction**:
   - Stay in the adjacent lane (\( Y = -5 \)) while passing the obstruction at \( X = 100 \).

3. **Return to Original Lane**:
   - Transition back from \( Y = -5 \) to \( Y = 0 \).
   - Assume this also takes 2 seconds.

---

### **Position Estimation**
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals. For simplicity, assume constant speed during the lane changes.

#### **Equations**:
- \( X(t) = X_0 + v \cdot t \), where \( v = 20 \, \text{m/s} \).
- \( Y(t) \):
  - For \( 0 \leq t < 2 \): \( Y(t) = -2.5 \cdot t \) (lane change to adjacent lane).
  - For \( 2 \leq t < 8 \): \( Y(t) = -5 \) (stay in adjacent lane).
  - For \( 8 \leq t \leq 10 \): \( Y(t) = -5 + 2.5 \cdot (t - 8) \) (return to original lane).

### **Position Table**
| Time (s) | \( X \) (m) | \( Y \) (m) |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| \( T = 0 \) | 0.0         | 0.0         |
| \( T = 1 \) | 20.0        | -2.5        |
| \( T = 2 \) | 40.0        | -5.0        |
| \( T = 3 \) | 60.0        | -5.0        |
| \( T = 4 \) | 80.0        | -5.0        |
| \( T = 5 \) | 100.0       | -5.0        |
| \( T = 6 \) | 120.0       | -5.0        |
| \( T = 7 \) | 140.0       | -5.0        |
| \( T = 8 \) | 160.0       | -5.0        |
| \( T = 9 \) | 180.0       | -2.5        |
| \( T = 10 \) | 200.0       | 0.0         |

### **Explanation**
1. **Lane Change**:
   - From \( T = 0 \) to \( T = 2 \), the vehicle transitions from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \).
   - \( X \) increases linearly at 20 m/s.

2. **Bypassing the Obstruction**:
   - From \( T = 2 \) to \( T = 8 \), the vehicle stays in the adjacent lane (\( Y = -5 \)).
   - The obstruction is bypassed at \( T = 5 \) when \( X = 100 \).

3. **Return to Original Lane**:
   - From \( T = 8 \) to \( T = 10 \), the vehicle transitions back to \( Y = 0 \).

### **Speed Constraint**
The vehicle¡¯s speed remains constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h), which satisfies the requirement of exceeding 60 km/h.

This plan ensures the obstruction is safely bypassed while maintaining the required speed.
