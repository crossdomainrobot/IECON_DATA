To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the maneuver into key phases: transitioning to the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. We'll estimate the vehicle's position at 1-second intervals over the next 10 seconds.

### Assumptions:
1. **Initial Velocity**: 72.0 km/h = 20 m/s (converted for ease of calculation).
2. **Speed Constraint**: Must maintain a speed ¡Ý 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).
3. **Lane Width**: The adjacent lane is at Y = -5 (5 meters to the left).
4. **Obstruction**: Located at (100, 0).
5. **Starting Point**: (0, 0).

### Steps:
1. **Lane Change to Adjacent Lane**: Smoothly transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over a short duration.
2. **Bypass Obstruction**: Maintain Y = -5 while passing X = 100.
3. **Lane Change Back to Original Lane**: Smoothly transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0.

### Calculations:
- **Time to Reach Obstruction**: At 20 m/s, the vehicle will reach X = 100 in \( \frac{100}{20} = 5 \) seconds.
- **Lane Change Duration**: Assume 2 seconds for each lane change (1 second to transition to the adjacent lane and 1 second to return).
- **Total Maneuver Time**: Approximately 10 seconds.

### Route Plan:
| Time (s) | X Position (m) | Y Position (m) | Notes                                |
|----------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| 0        | 0              | 0              | Starting point                       |
| 1        | 20             | -2.5           | Begin lane change                    |
| 2        | 40             | -5             | Fully in adjacent lane               |
| 3        | 60             | -5             | Bypassing obstruction                |
| 4        | 80             | -5             | Bypassing obstruction                |
| 5        | 100            | -5             | Obstruction cleared                  |
| 6        | 120            | -5             | Continue in adjacent lane            |
| 7        | 140            | -2.5           | Begin lane change back               |
| 8        | 160            | 0              | Fully back in original lane          |
| 9        | 180            | 0              | Continue in original lane            |
| 10       | 200            | 0              | Maneuver complete                    |

### Explanation:
1. **T = 0 to T = 2**: Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while moving forward at 20 m/s.
2. **T = 2 to T = 5**: Maintain Y = -5 while bypassing the obstruction at X = 100.
3. **T = 5 to T = 8**: Transition back to the original lane (Y = 0) while continuing forward.
4. **T = 8 to T = 10**: Continue in the original lane after completing the maneuver.

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed ¡Ý 60 km/h and safely navigates around the obstruction.
