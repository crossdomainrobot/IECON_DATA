To plan the route and estimate the vehicle¡¯s position at critical intervals, we¡¯ll break the task into phases:  
1. **Lane Transition (Outer Lane to Adjacent Lane)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction**  
3. **Lane Transition (Adjacent Lane Back to Outer Lane)**  

### Assumptions:
- **Initial Velocity**: 72.0 km/h = **20 m/s**  
- **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h = **16.67 m/s**  
- **Lane Width**: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane)  
- **Obstruction Position**: (100, 0)  
- **Time Interval**: 1 second (T = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10)  

### Strategy:
1. **Lane Transition**: Move from (0, 0) to (X, -5) over 3 seconds.  
2. **Bypass Obstruction**: Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until X > 100.  
3. **Return to Original Lane**: Move from (X, -5) back to (X, 0) over 3 seconds.  

### Position Estimates:

#### Phase 1: Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 3)
- **Lateral Movement**: Smooth transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds.  
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Constant speed of 20 m/s.  

| T (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|-------|-------|-------|  
| 0     | 0     | 0     |  
| 1     | 20    | -1.67 |  
| 2     | 40    | -3.33 |  
| 3     | 60    | -5    |  

#### Phase 2: Bypass Obstruction (T = 4 to T = 7)
- **Lateral Position**: Stay at Y = -5.  
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Constant speed of 20 m/s.  

| T (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|-------|-------|-------|  
| 4     | 80    | -5    |  
| 5     | 100   | -5    |  
| 6     | 120   | -5    |  
| 7     | 140   | -5    |  

#### Phase 3: Return to Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)
- **Lateral Movement**: Smooth transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.  
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Constant speed of 20 m/s.  

| T (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|-------|-------|-------|  
| 8     | 160   | -3.33 |  
| 9     | 180   | -1.67 |  
| 10    | 200   | 0     |  

### Summary:
- The vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane by T = 3.  
- It bypasses the obstruction at T = 5 (X = 100) while staying in the adjacent lane.  
- It returns to the original lane by T = 10.  
- Speed remains above 60 km/h throughout.  

### Final Positions:
| T (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|-------|-------|-------|  
| 0     | 0     | 0     |  
| 1     | 20    | -1.67 |  
| 2     | 40    | -3.33 |  
| 3     | 60    | -5    |  
| 4     | 80    | -5    |  
| 5     | 100   | -5    |  
| 6     | 120   | -5    |  
| 7     | 140   | -5    |  
| 8     | 160   | -3.33 |  
| 9     | 180   | -1.67 |  
| 10    | 200   | 0     |
