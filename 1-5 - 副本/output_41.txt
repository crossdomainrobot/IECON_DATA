To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the maneuver into key phases: transitioning to the adjacent lane, maintaining the lane while bypassing the obstruction, and transitioning back to the original lane. Here's a step-by-step outline of the vehicle's position \((X, Y)\) at critical intervals over the next 10 seconds:

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. **Initial conditions:**
   - Starting position: \((X, Y) = (0, 0)\)
   - Velocity: \(72.0 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s}\)
   - Obstruction: Located at \((100, 0)\)
   - Adjacent lane: \(Y = -5\)

2. **Constraints:**
   - Speed must exceed \(60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s}\).
   - Lane transitions should be smooth and safe.

---

### **Route Plan:**

#### **1. Lane Transition to Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):**
- **Time interval:** \(T = 0\) to \(T = 3\) seconds
- **Lateral movement:** Transition from \(Y = 0\) to \(Y = -5\) over 3 seconds.
- **Lateral speed:** \(\frac{-5}{3} \approx -1.67 \, \text{m/s}\)
- **Forward speed:** Maintain \(20 \, \text{m/s}\).

| \(T\) (s) | \(X\) (m) | \(Y\) (m) |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 0         | 0         | 0         |
| 1         | 20        | -1.67     |
| 2         | 40        | -3.33     |
| 3         | 60        | -5        |

---

#### **2. Bypass the Obstruction in Adjacent Lane:**
- **Time interval:** \(T = 3\) to \(T = 7\) seconds
- **Lateral position:** Maintain \(Y = -5\).
- **Forward speed:** Maintain \(20 \, \text{m/s}\).

| \(T\) (s) | \(X\) (m) | \(Y\) (m) |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 4         | 80        | -5        |
| 5         | 100       | -5        |
| 6         | 120       | -5        |
| 7         | 140       | -5        |

---

#### **3. Lane Transition Back to Original Lane (Y = 0):**
- **Time interval:** \(T = 7\) to \(T = 10\) seconds
- **Lateral movement:** Transition from \(Y = -5\) to \(Y = 0\) over 3 seconds.
- **Lateral speed:** \(\frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67 \, \text{m/s}\)
- **Forward speed:** Maintain \(20 \, \text{m/s}\).

| \(T\) (s) | \(X\) (m) | \(Y\) (m) |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 8         | 160       | -3.33     |
| 9         | 180       | -1.67     |
| 10        | 200       | 0         |

---

### **Summary of Positions:**

| \(T\) (s) | \(X\) (m) | \(Y\) (m) |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 0         | 0         | 0         |
| 1         | 20        | -1.67     |
| 2         | 40        | -3.33     |
| 3         | 60        | -5        |
| 4         | 80        | -5        |
| 5         | 100       | -5        |
| 6         | 120       | -5        |
| 7         | 140       | -5        |
| 8         | 160       | -3.33     |
| 9         | 180       | -1.67     |
| 10        | 200       | 0         |

### **Key Points:**
1. The vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane by \(T = 3\) seconds and remains there until \(T = 7\) seconds to bypass the obstruction.
2. The vehicle returns to the original lane by \(T = 10\) seconds.
3. Speed remains constant at \(20 \, \text{m/s}\) (\(72 \, \text{km/h}\)), satisfying the constraint of exceeding \(60 \, \text{km/h}\).
