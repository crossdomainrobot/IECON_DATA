To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we need to calculate the vehicle's position at critical intervals. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Initial Conditions:
- **Starting Position:** (0.0, 0)
- **Obstruction Position:** (100, 0)
- **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate:** -5
- **Initial Velocity:** 72.0 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum Speed:** 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)

### Assumptions:
- The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 72.0 km/h (20 m/s) throughout the maneuver.
- The lane change is instantaneous at the moment of transition.

### Critical Intervals:
We will calculate the vehicle's position every second for the next 10 seconds.

### Calculations:
1. **At T = 0s:**
   - Position: (0.0, 0)

2. **At T = 1s:**
   - Distance traveled: 20 m/s * 1s = 20 m
   - Position: (20, 0)

3. **At T = 2s:**
   - Distance traveled: 20 m/s * 2s = 40 m
   - Position: (40, 0)

4. **At T = 3s:**
   - Distance traveled: 20 m/s * 3s = 60 m
   - Position: (60, 0)

5. **At T = 4s:**
   - Distance traveled: 20 m/s * 4s = 80 m
   - Position: (80, 0)

6. **At T = 5s:**
   - Distance traveled: 20 m/s * 5s = 100 m
   - Position: (100, -5)  (Lane change to bypass obstruction)

7. **At T = 6s:**
   - Distance traveled: 20 m/s * 6s = 120 m
   - Position: (120, -5)

8. **At T = 7s:**
   - Distance traveled: 20 m/s * 7s = 140 m
   - Position: (140, -5)

9. **At T = 8s:**
   - Distance traveled: 20 m/s * 8s = 160 m
   - Position: (160, -5)

10. **At T = 9s:**
    - Distance traveled: 20 m/s * 9s = 180 m
    - Position: (180, -5)

11. **At T = 10s:**
    - Distance traveled: 20 m/s * 10s = 200 m
    - Position: (200, 0)  (Return to original lane)

### Summary of Positions:
- **T = 0s:** (0.0, 0)
- **T = 1s:** (20, 0)
- **T = 2s:** (40, 0)
- **T = 3s:** (60, 0)
- **T = 4s:** (80, 0)
- **T = 5s:** (100, -5)
- **T = 6s:** (120, -5)
- **T = 7s:** (140, -5)
- **T = 8s:** (160, -5)
- **T = 9s:** (180, -5)
- **T = 10s:** (200, 0)

### Conclusion:
By following this route plan, the vehicle successfully navigates around the obstruction at X = 100 meters by transitioning to the adjacent lane at T = 5s and returning to the original lane at T = 10s, all while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
