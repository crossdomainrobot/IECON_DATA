To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we'll break down the maneuver into key phases: **lane change preparation**, **lane change execution**, **bypassing the obstruction**, and **returning to the original lane**. We'll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals (T = 1, 2, ..., 10) using the provided spatial reference system.

### **Assumptions and Initial Conditions**
1. **Starting Position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0) at T = 0.
2. **Vehicle Speed**: 72 km/h (20 m/s), maintained throughout.
3. **Obstruction Location**: (100, 0).
4. **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5.
5. **Lane Change Duration**: 2 seconds (from T = 3 to T = 5).
6. **Bypassing Obstruction**: Stay in the adjacent lane until X > 100.
7. **Return to Original Lane**: Begin at T = 7, complete by T = 9.

### **Position Calculations**
At each second, the vehicle moves forward by 20 m (since speed = 20 m/s). Lateral movement (Y-coordinate) occurs during lane changes.

#### **1. Lane Change Preparation (T = 0 to T = 3)**
- The vehicle remains in the original lane (Y = 0).
- Positions:
  - T = 1: (20, 0)
  - T = 2: (40, 0)
  - T = 3: (60, 0)

#### **2. Lane Change Execution (T = 3 to T = 5)**
- Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) over 2 seconds.
- Lateral movement: Y changes linearly from 0 to -5.
- Positions:
  - T = 4: (80, -2.5)
  - T = 5: (100, -5)

#### **3. Bypassing Obstruction (T = 5 to T = 7)**
- Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until X > 100.
- Positions:
  - T = 6: (120, -5)
  - T = 7: (140, -5)

#### **4. Returning to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 9)**
- Transition back to the original lane (Y = 0) over 2 seconds.
- Lateral movement: Y changes linearly from -5 to 0.
- Positions:
  - T = 8: (160, -2.5)
  - T = 9: (180, 0)

#### **5. Continue in Original Lane (T = 9 to T = 10)**
- Remain in the original lane (Y = 0).
- Position:
  - T = 10: (200, 0)

### **Summary of Positions**
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y)    |
|----------|--------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)            |
| 1        | (20, 0)           |
| 2        | (40, 0)           |
| 3        | (60, 0)           |
| 4        | (80, -2.5)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)         |
| 6        | (120, -5)         |
| 7        | (140, -5)         |
| 8        | (160, -2.5)       |
| 9        | (180, 0)          |
| 10       | (200, 0)          |

### **Key Points**
1. The lane change is completed just as the vehicle reaches the obstruction (X = 100) at T = 5.
2. The vehicle bypasses the obstruction in the adjacent lane and returns to the original lane by T = 9.
3. Speed is maintained at 72 km/h throughout, ensuring it exceeds the minimum requirement of 60 km/h.
