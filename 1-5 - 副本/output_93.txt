To plan the lane transition and bypass the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we need to calculate the vehicle's position at critical intervals. Here¡¯s the step-by-step route planning:

---

### **Given:**
- **Starting position:** (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Obstruction position:** (X, Y) = (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane position:** Y = -5
- **Initial speed:** 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum speed:** 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- **Time intervals:** T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 seconds

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle moves at a constant speed of 72 km/h (20 m/s) throughout.
2. The lane change is smooth and takes 2 seconds to transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
3. The vehicle stays in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until it bypasses the obstruction (X = 100).
4. The vehicle returns to the original lane (Y = 0) after bypassing the obstruction.

### **Step 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)**
- **Lateral movement:** Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.
- **Longitudinal movement:** X increases at 20 m/s.
- **Positions:**
  - T = 0: (0, 0)
  - T = 1: (20, -2.5)
  - T = 2: (40, -5)

---

### **Step 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 5 seconds)**
- **Lateral position:** Stay at Y = -5.
- **Longitudinal movement:** X increases at 20 m/s.
- **Positions:**
  - T = 3: (60, -5)
  - T = 4: (80, -5)
  - T = 5: (100, -5)

---

### **Step 3: Return to Original Lane (T = 5 to T = 7 seconds)**
- **Lateral movement:** Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.
- **Longitudinal movement:** X increases at 20 m/s.
- **Positions:**
  - T = 6: (120, -2.5)
  - T = 7: (140, 0)

---

### **Step 4: Continue in Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds)**
- **Lateral position:** Stay at Y = 0.
- **Longitudinal movement:** X increases at 20 m/s.
- **Positions:**
  - T = 8: (160, 0)
  - T = 9: (180, 0)
  - T = 10: (200, 0)

### **Summary of Positions:**
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |
| 2        | 40    | -5    |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -2.5  |
| 7        | 140   | 0     |
| 8        | 160   | 0     |
| 9        | 180   | 0     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### **Key Notes:**
- The vehicle successfully bypasses the obstruction at X = 100 while staying in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
- The speed remains constant at 72 km/h (20 m/s) throughout the maneuver.
- The lane transitions are smooth and take 2 seconds each.
