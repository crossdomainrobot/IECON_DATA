To plan the lane transition and bypass the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we need to calculate the vehicle's position over time. Here's the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Given:**
- **Starting position:** (X, Y) = (0.0, 0)
- **Obstruction position:** (X, Y) = (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate:** Y = -5
- **Initial velocity:** 72.0 km/h = 20 m/s (since 1 km/h = 1000/3600 m/s)
- **Minimum speed:** 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s
- **Time interval:** 1 second (T = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10)

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s.
2. The lane transition (changing Y-coordinate) takes 2 seconds:
   - From T = 0 to T = 2: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
   - From T = 8 to T = 10: Transition from Y = -5 back to Y = 0.
3. The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while bypassing the obstruction (X = 100).

### **Position Calculations:**

#### **1. Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2):**
- **Y-coordinate:** Linearly changes from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.
  - At T = 0: Y = 0
  - At T = 1: Y = -2.5
  - At T = 2: Y = -5
- **X-coordinate:** Increases at 20 m/s.
  - At T = 0: X = 0
  - At T = 1: X = 20
  - At T = 2: X = 40

#### **2. Bypassing Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 8):**
- **Y-coordinate:** Remains at Y = -5.
- **X-coordinate:** Increases at 20 m/s.
  - At T = 3: X = 60
  - At T = 4: X = 80
  - At T = 5: X = 100 (obstruction bypassed)
  - At T = 6: X = 120
  - At T = 7: X = 140
  - At T = 8: X = 160

#### **3. Lane Transition Back (T = 8 to T = 10):**
- **Y-coordinate:** Linearly changes from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.
  - At T = 8: Y = -5
  - At T = 9: Y = -2.5
  - At T = 10: Y = 0
- **X-coordinate:** Increases at 20 m/s.
  - At T = 9: X = 180
  - At T = 10: X = 200

### **Final Position Table:**

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| T = 0    | 0     | 0     |
| T = 1    | 20    | -2.5  |
| T = 2    | 40    | -5    |
| T = 3    | 60    | -5    |
| T = 4    | 80    | -5    |
| T = 5    | 100   | -5    |
| T = 6    | 120   | -5    |
| T = 7    | 140   | -5    |
| T = 8    | 160   | -5    |
| T = 9    | 180   | -2.5  |
| T = 10   | 200   | 0     |

### **Summary:**
1. The vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) between T = 0 and T = 2.
2. It bypasses the obstruction at X = 100 while remaining in the adjacent lane.
3. It transitions back to the original lane (Y = 0) between T = 8 and T = 10.
4. The speed is maintained at 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver, satisfying the minimum speed requirement.
