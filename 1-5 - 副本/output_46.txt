To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we'll break the maneuver into phases: **lane transition**, **bypassing the obstruction**, and **returning to the original lane**. We'll calculate the vehicle's position (X, Y) at 1-second intervals over the next 10 seconds.

### **Given:**
- **Initial position:** (X, Y) = (0.0, 0)
- **Obstruction position:** (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate:** Y = -5
- **Initial velocity:** 72.0 km/h = 20 m/s (constant speed)
- **Minimum speed:** 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s (not a constraint here since speed is constant)
- **Time intervals:** T = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10 seconds

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The lane transition is smooth and linear over 2 seconds (T = 0 to T = 2).
2. The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until it has bypassed the obstruction (X = 100).
3. The return to the original lane is smooth and linear over 2 seconds (T = 6 to T = 8).

---

### **Route Plan:**

1. **Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2):**
   - Move from Y = 0 to Y = -5 linearly over 2 seconds.

2. **Bypassing Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6):**
   - Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until X > 100.

3. **Return to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8):**
   - Move from Y = -5 to Y = 0 linearly over 2 seconds.

4. **Continue in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10):**
   - Stay in the original lane (Y = 0).

### **Position Estimates:**

| Time (T) | X (m)          | Y (m)          |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| 0        | 0.0            | 0.0            |
| 1        | 20.0           | -2.5           |
| 2        | 40.0           | -5.0           |
| 3        | 60.0           | -5.0           |
| 4        | 80.0           | -5.0           |
| 5        | 100.0          | -5.0           |
| 6        | 120.0          | -5.0           |
| 7        | 140.0          | -2.5           |
| 8        | 160.0          | 0.0            |
| 9        | 180.0          | 0.0            |
| 10       | 200.0          | 0.0            |

### **Explanation:**
1. **X-coordinate:** Increases linearly at 20 m/s (72 km/h).
2. **Y-coordinate:** Transitions smoothly between lanes during T = 0-2 and T = 6-8.
3. **Obstruction bypass:** The vehicle enters the adjacent lane at T = 2 and returns to the original lane at T = 8, ensuring the obstruction at X = 100 is safely bypassed.

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains speed and navigates the obstruction safely.
