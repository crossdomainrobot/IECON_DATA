To plan the route and estimate the vehicle's position at critical intervals, we'll break down the maneuver into key phases: **lane change to the adjacent lane**, **bypassing the obstruction**, and **returning to the original lane**. We'll calculate the vehicle's position at 1-second intervals over the next 10 seconds. Here's the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Given:**
- **Initial position:** (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Obstruction location:** (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate:** Y = -5
- **Initial velocity:** 72.0 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum speed:** Must exceed 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s throughout the maneuver.
2. The lane change takes **2 seconds** (1 second to move into the adjacent lane and 1 second to return to the original lane).
3. The vehicle bypasses the obstruction by staying in the adjacent lane for **4 seconds** (from T = 2 to T = 6).

---

### **Route Plan:**
1. **Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2):**
   - At T = 1, the vehicle begins transitioning to the adjacent lane.
   - At T = 2, the vehicle is fully in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).

2. **Bypassing Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6):**
   - The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while bypassing the obstruction.

3. **Returning to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8):**
   - At T = 6, the vehicle begins transitioning back to the original lane.
   - At T = 8, the vehicle is fully in the original lane (Y = 0).

4. **Continuing in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10):**
   - The vehicle continues traveling in the original lane (Y = 0).

### **Position Estimates:**
The vehicle¡¯s X-coordinate increases linearly with time: **X = 20 * T**.

Here are the estimated positions at 1-second intervals:

| Time (T) | X (m) | Y (m) | Notes                           |
|----------|-------|-------|---------------------------------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     | Starting position               |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  | Transitioning to adjacent lane  |
| 2        | 40    | -5    | Fully in adjacent lane          |
| 3        | 60    | -5    | Bypassing obstruction           |
| 4        | 80    | -5    | Bypassing obstruction           |
| 5        | 100   | -5    | Bypassing obstruction           |
| 6        | 120   | -2.5  | Transitioning back to original lane |
| 7        | 140   | 0     | Fully in original lane          |
| 8        | 160   | 0     | Continuing in original lane     |
| 9        | 180   | 0     | Continuing in original lane     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     | Continuing in original lane     |

---

### **Explanation:**
1. **Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2):**
   - The vehicle transitions from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds. At T = 1, it is halfway through the transition (Y = -2.5).

2. **Bypassing Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6):**
   - The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while traveling from X = 40 to X = 120.

3. **Returning to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8):**
   - The vehicle transitions from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds. At T = 7, it is halfway through the transition (Y = -2.5).

4. **Continuing in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10):**
   - The vehicle continues traveling in the original lane (Y = 0) from X = 160 to X = 200.

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction safely while maintaining a speed exceeding 60 km/h.
