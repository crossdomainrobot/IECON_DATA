To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the process into phases:  
1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**  

We¡¯ll assume smooth transitions and a constant speed of **72 km/h (20 m/s)** throughout the maneuver. The obstruction is at **X = 100 meters**, and the adjacent lane is at **Y = -5 meters**.

### Route Plan:  
Let¡¯s define the vehicle¡¯s position **(X, Y)** at critical time intervals (T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 seconds).  

#### Assumptions:  
- The lane change takes **2 seconds** to complete (from Y = 0 to Y = -5).  
- The vehicle maintains a constant speed of **20 m/s** along the X-axis.  

---

#### Phase 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (Y = 0 to Y = -5)  
- **Time: T = 0 to T = 2 seconds**  
- **Y-coordinate:** Linearly transitions from Y = 0 to Y = -5.  
- **X-coordinate:** Increases at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |  
| 2        | 40    | -5    |  

---

#### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 40 to X = 160)  
- **Time: T = 2 to T = 8 seconds**  
- **Y-coordinate:** Remains at Y = -5.  
- **X-coordinate:** Increases at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    |  
| 7        | 140   | -5    |  
| 8        | 160   | -5    |  

---

#### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to Original Lane (Y = -5 to Y = 0)  
- **Time: T = 8 to T = 10 seconds**  
- **Y-coordinate:** Linearly transitions from Y = -5 to Y = 0.  
- **X-coordinate:** Increases at 20 m/s.  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 9        | 180   | -2.5  |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |  

---

### Summary:  
The vehicle successfully navigates around the obstruction by transitioning to the adjacent lane, bypassing the blockage, and returning to the original lane. The positions at critical intervals are as follows:  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |  
| 2        | 40    | -5    |  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    |  
| 7        | 140   | -5    |  
| 8        | 160   | -5    |  
| 9        | 180   | -2.5  |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |  

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed of **72 km/h** and avoids the obstruction at **X = 100 meters**.
