To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Returning to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**  

### Assumptions:
- Initial velocity: 72.0 km/h = 20 m/s  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s  
- Obstruction is at X = 100 meters.  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).  
- Lane change duration: 3 seconds (smooth transition).  
- Bypassing the obstruction: Maintain the adjacent lane until X > 100 meters.  
- Return to the original lane: Another 3 seconds.

### Step-by-Step Plan:

#### **Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)**  
- **T = 0 seconds**: Starting position (0, 0).  
- **T = 1 second**: Move halfway laterally. Position: (20, -2.5).  
- **T = 2 seconds**: Complete lane change. Position: (40, -5).  
- **T = 3 seconds**: Maintain lane. Position: (60, -5).  

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 4 to T = 7 seconds)**  
- **T = 4 seconds**: Position: (80, -5).  
- **T = 5 seconds**: Position: (100, -5).  
- **T = 6 seconds**: Position: (120, -5).  
- **T = 7 seconds**: Position: (140, -5).  

#### **Phase 3: Return to Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds)**  
- **T = 8 seconds**: Begin returning. Position: (160, -2.5).  
- **T = 9 seconds**: Complete return. Position: (180, 0).  
- **T = 10 seconds**: Maintain lane. Position: (200, 0).

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| 0        | (0, 0)          |  
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |  
| 2        | (40, -5)        |  
| 3        | (60, -5)        |  
| 4        | (80, -5)        |  
| 5        | (100, -5)       |  
| 6        | (120, -5)       |  
| 7        | (140, -5)       |  
| 8        | (160, -2.5)     |  
| 9        | (180, 0)        |  
| 10       | (200, 0)        |  

This plan ensures the obstruction is bypassed safely while maintaining speed above 60 km/h.
