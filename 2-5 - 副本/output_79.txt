To navigate around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll plan the lane transitions carefully. Here¡¯s the step-by-step route planning:

### Initial Conditions:
- **Starting Position**: (0.0, 0)  
- **Obstruction Position**: (100, 0)  
- **Adjacent Lane Position**: Y = -5  
- **Initial Velocity**: 72.0 km/h (20 m/s)  
- **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)  

### Assumptions:
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.  
2. Lane changes take **2 seconds** each (a reasonable assumption for smooth transitions).  
3. The vehicle moves laterally at a constant rate during lane changes.  

### Route Plan:
1. **Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**:
   - Start at T = 0, Position = (0, 0).  
   - Begin lane change at T = 0, complete at T = 2.  
   - Lateral movement: From Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.  
   - Lateral speed: \( \frac{-5}{2} = -2.5 \, \text{m/s} \).  

2. **Bypass the Obstruction**:
   - Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until the obstruction is passed.  
   - Obstruction is at X = 100.  
   - Time to reach X = 100: \( \frac{100}{20} = 5 \, \text{seconds} \).  

3. **Lane Change Back to Original Lane (Y = 0)**:
   - Start lane change at T = 5, complete at T = 7.  
   - Lateral movement: From Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.  
   - Lateral speed: \( \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \, \text{m/s} \).  

4. **Continue in Original Lane**:
   - Stay in the original lane (Y = 0) after T = 7.  

### Position Estimates at Critical Intervals:
- **T = 0**: (0, 0)  
- **T = 1**: (20, -2.5)  
- **T = 2**: (40, -5)  
- **T = 3**: (60, -5)  
- **T = 4**: (80, -5)  
- **T = 5**: (100, -5)  
- **T = 6**: (120, -2.5)  
- **T = 7**: (140, 0)  
- **T = 8**: (160, 0)  
- **T = 9**: (180, 0)  
- **T = 10**: (200, 0)  

### Summary:
- The vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane between T = 0 and T = 2.  
- It stays in the adjacent lane until T = 5, bypassing the obstruction.  
- It transitions back to the original lane between T = 5 and T = 7.  
- After T = 7, the vehicle continues in the original lane.  

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h and safely navigates around the obstruction.
