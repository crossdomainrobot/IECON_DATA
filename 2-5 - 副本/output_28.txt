To plan the route and estimate the vehicle¡¯s position at critical intervals, we need to consider the following:

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - Starting position: (0, 0)
   - Obstruction position: (100, 0)
   - Adjacent lane¡¯s Y-coordinate: Y = -5
   - Initial velocity: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
   - Minimum speed to maintain: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)

2. **Time Frame**:
   - Total time: 10 seconds
   - Time intervals: 1 second (T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10)

3. **Assumptions**:
   - The vehicle transitions to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) in a straight-line path.
   - The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
   - The lane transition takes 2 seconds (T = 0 to T = 2).
   - The vehicle stays in the adjacent lane until it passes the obstruction at X = 100.
   - The vehicle transitions back to the original lane (Y = 0) in another 2 seconds (T = 8 to T = 10).

4. **Route Planning**:
   - **T = 0 to T = 2**: Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
   - **T = 2 to T = 8**: Stay in the adjacent lane and bypass the obstruction.
   - **T = 8 to T = 10**: Transition back to the original lane (Y = 0).

5. **Position Estimation**:
   - At T = 0: (0, 0)
   - At T = 1: (20, -2.5) (Midway in lane transition)
   - At T = 2: (40, -5) (Fully in the adjacent lane)
   - At T = 3: (60, -5)
   - At T = 4: (80, -5)
   - At T = 5: (100, -5) (Bypassing the obstruction)
   - At T = 6: (120, -5)
   - At T = 7: (140, -5)
   - At T = 8: (160, -5)
   - At T = 9: (180, -2.5) (Midway in lane transition back)
   - At T = 10: (200, 0) (Fully back in the original lane)

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|-----------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |
| 2        | (40, -5)        |
| 3        | (60, -5)        |
| 4        | (80, -5)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -5)       |
| 7        | (140, -5)       |
| 8        | (160, -5)       |
| 9        | (180, -2.5)     |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction, maintains a speed exceeding 60 km/h, and completes the lane transitions safely.
