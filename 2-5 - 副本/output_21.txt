To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we need to break down the motion into three phases: **(1) Transitioning to the adjacent lane**, **(2) Bypassing the obstruction**, and **(3) Returning to the original lane**. Here¡¯s the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Given Parameters:**
- **Initial Position (T = 0):** (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Obstruction Position:** (100, 0)
- **Adjacent Lane Y-Coordinate:** Y = -5
- **Initial Speed:** 72.0 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum Speed:** 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- **Time Interval:** 10 seconds (T = 0 to T = 10)
- **Assumption:** Constant speed of 20 m/s (simplified for this plan).

---

### **Route Plan:**

#### **Phase 1: Transition to the Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2.5 seconds)**
- **Duration:** 2.5 seconds
- **Lateral Movement:** From Y = 0 to Y = -5
- **Lateral Speed:** \(-5 \, \text{m} / 2.5 \, \text{s} = -2 \, \text{m/s}\)
- **Positions:**
  - T = 1: (20, -2)
  - T = 2: (40, -4)
  - T = 2.5: (50, -5)

#### **Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction (T = 2.5 to T = 5 seconds)**
- **Duration:** 2.5 seconds
- **Lateral Position:** Y = -5 (stay in the adjacent lane)
- **Positions:**
  - T = 3: (60, -5)
  - T = 4: (80, -5)
  - T = 5: (100, -5)

#### **Phase 3: Return to the Original Lane (T = 5 to T = 7.5 seconds)**
- **Duration:** 2.5 seconds
- **Lateral Movement:** From Y = -5 to Y = 0
- **Lateral Speed:** \(5 \, \text{m} / 2.5 \, \text{s} = 2 \, \text{m/s}\)
- **Positions:**
  - T = 6: (120, -3)
  - T = 7: (140, -1)
  - T = 7.5: (150, 0)

#### **Phase 4: Continue in the Original Lane (T = 7.5 to T = 10 seconds)**
- **Duration:** 2.5 seconds
- **Lateral Position:** Y = 0
- **Positions:**
  - T = 8: (160, 0)
  - T = 9: (180, 0)
  - T = 10: (200, 0)

### **Summary of Positions at Critical Intervals:**
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)           |
| 1        | (20, -2)         |
| 2        | (40, -4)         |
| 2.5      | (50, -5)         |
| 3        | (60, -5)         |
| 4        | (80, -5)         |
| 5        | (100, -5)        |
| 6        | (120, -3)        |
| 7        | (140, -1)        |
| 7.5      | (150, 0)         |
| 8        | (160, 0)         |
| 9        | (180, 0)         |
| 10       | (200, 0)         |

### **Notes:**
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
2. The obstruction is bypassed safely by staying in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) from T = 2.5 to T = 5 seconds.
3. The lane transitions are completed smoothly within 2.5 seconds each.
4. The minimum speed requirement (>60 km/h) is satisfied.
