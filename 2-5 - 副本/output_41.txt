To plan the route, we'll need to calculate the vehicle's position at critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. The vehicle starts at position (0, 0) with an initial velocity of 72.0 km/h. The obstruction is at (100, 0), and the adjacent lane is at Y = -5. The vehicle must maintain a speed exceeding 60 km/h throughout the maneuver.

### Step 1: Convert speed to meters per second (m/s)
- Initial speed: 72.0 km/h = 72.0 * (1000/3600) = 20 m/s
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h = 60 * (1000/3600) ¡Ö 16.67 m/s

### Step 2: Determine the time required to reach the obstruction
- Distance to obstruction: 100 meters
- Time to reach obstruction: 100 m / 20 m/s = 5 seconds

### Step 3: Plan the lane transition and bypass
1. **Lane Transition Phase (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)**:
   - The vehicle will transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.
   - Lateral speed: 5 meters / 2 seconds = 2.5 m/s
   - Position at T = 1 second: (20 * 1, -2.5) = (20, -2.5)
   - Position at T = 2 seconds: (20 * 2, -5) = (40, -5)

2. **Bypass Phase (T = 2 to T = 5 seconds)**:
   - The vehicle will continue in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until it bypasses the obstruction.
   - Position at T = 3 seconds: (20 * 3, -5) = (60, -5)
   - Position at T = 4 seconds: (20 * 4, -5) = (80, -5)
   - Position at T = 5 seconds: (20 * 5, -5) = (100, -5)

3. **Return to Original Lane Phase (T = 5 to T = 7 seconds)**:
   - The vehicle will transition from Y = -5 back to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.
   - Lateral speed: 5 meters / 2 seconds = 2.5 m/s
   - Position at T = 6 seconds: (20 * 6, -2.5) = (120, -2.5)
   - Position at T = 7 seconds: (20 * 7, 0) = (140, 0)

4. **Continue in Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds)**:
   - The vehicle will continue in the original lane (Y = 0).
   - Position at T = 8 seconds: (20 * 8, 0) = (160, 0)
   - Position at T = 9 seconds: (20 * 9, 0) = (180, 0)
   - Position at T = 10 seconds: (20 * 10, 0) = (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions:
- T = 0 s: (0, 0)
- T = 1 s: (20, -2.5)
- T = 2 s: (40, -5)
- T = 3 s: (60, -5)
- T = 4 s: (80, -5)
- T = 5 s: (100, -5)
- T = 6 s: (120, -2.5)
- T = 7 s: (140, 0)
- T = 8 s: (160, 0)
- T = 9 s: (180, 0)
- T = 10 s: (200, 0)

### Verification:
- The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s throughout, which is above the minimum required speed of 16.67 m/s.
- The obstruction at (100, 0) is successfully bypassed by staying in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) from T = 2 to T = 5 seconds.

This plan ensures a smooth lane transition, bypass of the obstruction, and return to the original lane while maintaining the required speed.
