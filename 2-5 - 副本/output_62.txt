To plan the route and estimate the vehicle's position at critical intervals, we'll break down the maneuver into several phases:

1. **Initial Phase (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds):**  
   - The vehicle is in the outer lane (Y = 0) moving at 72 km/h (20 m/s).
   - At T = 0, position: (0, 0).  
   - At T = 1, position: (20, 0).  
   - At T = 2, position: (40, 0).  

2. **Lane Transition Phase (T = 2 to T = 4 seconds):**  
   - The vehicle begins transitioning to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
   - Assume a smooth lateral movement over 2 seconds.  
   - At T = 3, position: (60, -2.5).  
   - At T = 4, position: (80, -5).  

3. **Bypass Phase (T = 4 to T = 6 seconds):**  
   - The vehicle continues in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) to bypass the obstruction.  
   - At T = 5, position: (100, -5).  
   - At T = 6, position: (120, -5).  

4. **Return Transition Phase (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds):**  
   - The vehicle transitions back to the original lane (Y = 0).  
   - Assume a smooth lateral movement over 2 seconds.  
   - At T = 7, position: (140, -2.5).  
   - At T = 8, position: (160, 0).  

5. **Final Phase (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds):**  
   - The vehicle continues in the original lane (Y = 0).  
   - At T = 9, position: (180, 0).  
   - At T = 10, position: (200, 0).  

### Summary of Positions:
- T = 0: (0, 0)  
- T = 1: (20, 0)  
- T = 2: (40, 0)  
- T = 3: (60, -2.5)  
- T = 4: (80, -5)  
- T = 5: (100, -5)  
- T = 6: (120, -5)  
- T = 7: (140, -2.5)  
- T = 8: (160, 0)  
- T = 9: (180, 0)  
- T = 10: (200, 0)  

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
