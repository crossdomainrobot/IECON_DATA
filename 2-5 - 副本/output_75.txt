To plan the lane transition and bypass the obstruction while maintaining a speed exceeding 60 km/h, we¡¯ll break down the maneuver into key steps and estimate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals. Here's the plan:

---

### **Given:**
- **Starting position:** \( (X, Y) = (0, 0) \)  
- **Obstruction position:** \( (100, 0) \)  
- **Adjacent lane position:** \( Y = -5 \)  
- **Initial velocity:** \( 72.0 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- **Minimum speed:** \( 60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- **Time interval:** \( 1 \, \text{second} \)

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The lane transition (lateral movement) takes **2 seconds** (from \( T = 0 \) to \( T = 2 \)).  
2. The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane for **6 seconds** (from \( T = 2 \) to \( T = 8 \)) to bypass the obstruction.  
3. The return to the original lane takes **2 seconds** (from \( T = 8 \) to \( T = 10 \)).  

---

### **Route Planning:**

#### **1. Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2):**
- Move laterally from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \) over 2 seconds.  
- Lateral speed: \( \frac{5 \, \text{m}}{2 \, \text{s}} = 2.5 \, \text{m/s} \).  
- Forward speed: Maintain \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).  

#### **2. Bypassing Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 8):**
- Stay in the adjacent lane (\( Y = -5 \)).  
- Forward speed: Maintain \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).  

#### **3. Return to Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10):**
- Move laterally from \( Y = -5 \) to \( Y = 0 \) over 2 seconds.  
- Lateral speed: \( \frac{5 \, \text{m}}{2 \, \text{s}} = 2.5 \, \text{m/s} \).  
- Forward speed: Maintain \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).

### **Position Estimates:**

| Time (s) | \( X \) (m) | \( Y \) (m) | Description                       |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| \( T = 0 \) | \( 0 \)     | \( 0 \)     | Starting position                |
| \( T = 1 \) | \( 20 \)    | \( -2.5 \)  | Transitioning to adjacent lane   |
| \( T = 2 \) | \( 40 \)    | \( -5 \)    | Fully in adjacent lane           |
| \( T = 3 \) | \( 60 \)    | \( -5 \)    | Bypassing obstruction            |
| \( T = 4 \) | \( 80 \)    | \( -5 \)    | Bypassing obstruction            |
| \( T = 5 \) | \( 100 \)   | \( -5 \)    | Reaches obstruction location     |
| \( T = 6 \) | \( 120 \)   | \( -5 \)    | Bypassing obstruction            |
| \( T = 7 \) | \( 140 \)   | \( -5 \)    | Bypassing obstruction            |
| \( T = 8 \) | \( 160 \)   | \( -5 \)    | Ready to return to original lane |
| \( T = 9 \) | \( 180 \)   | \( -2.5 \)  | Transitioning to original lane   |
| \( T = 10 \) | \( 200 \)  | \( 0 \)     | Fully in original lane           |

### **Explanation:**
1. **Lane Transition:** The vehicle moves laterally to the adjacent lane while continuing forward at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).  
2. **Bypassing Obstruction:** The vehicle stays in the adjacent lane until it has safely passed the obstruction at \( X = 100 \).  
3. **Return to Original Lane:** The vehicle moves back to the original lane while maintaining forward speed.  

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above \( 60 \, \text{km/h} \) and safely navigates around the obstruction.
