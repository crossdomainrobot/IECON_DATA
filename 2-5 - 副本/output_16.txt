To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**  

### Assumptions:
- Initial velocity: \( 72.0 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- Minimum speed: \( 60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- Lane width: \( 5 \, \text{m} \) (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane)  
- Obstruction at \( X = 100 \, \text{m} \)  
- Time step: \( 1 \, \text{second} \)  

### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)
- Duration: Assume \( 3 \, \text{seconds} \) for a smooth lane change.  
- Lateral movement: \( Y \) transitions from \( 0 \) to \( -5 \) linearly over \( 3 \, \text{seconds} \).  
- Longitudinal movement: \( X \) increases at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).  

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)
- Duration: Ensure the vehicle is in the adjacent lane while \( X \) passes \( 100 \, \text{m} \).  
- Lateral position: \( Y = -5 \).  
- Longitudinal movement: \( X \) continues at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).  

### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)
- Duration: Assume \( 3 \, \text{seconds} \) for a smooth lane change.  
- Lateral movement: \( Y \) transitions from \( -5 \) to \( 0 \) linearly over \( 3 \, \text{seconds} \).  
- Longitudinal movement: \( X \) increases at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).  

### Route Plan:
| Time (s) | \( X \) (m) | \( Y \) (m) | Description                     |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------------------------|
| 0        | 0.0         | 0.0         | Starting position               |
| 1        | 20.0        | -1.67       | Lane change begins              |
| 2        | 40.0        | -3.33       | Lane change in progress         |
| 3        | 60.0        | -5.0        | Fully in adjacent lane          |
| 4        | 80.0        | -5.0        | Approaching obstruction         |
| 5        | 100.0       | -5.0        | Bypassing obstruction           |
| 6        | 120.0       | -3.33       | Lane change back begins         |
| 7        | 140.0       | -1.67       | Lane change back in progress    |
| 8        | 160.0       | 0.0         | Fully back in original lane     |
| 9        | 180.0       | 0.0         | Continuing in original lane     |
| 10       | 200.0       | 0.0         | Maneuver complete               |

### Explanation:
- **Lane Change**: The lateral position \( Y \) changes linearly from \( 0 \) to \( -5 \) over \( 3 \, \text{seconds} \).  
- **Bypassing Obstruction**: The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (\( Y = -5 \)) while \( X \) passes \( 100 \, \text{m} \).  
- **Lane Change Back**: The lateral position \( Y \) changes linearly from \( -5 \) to \( 0 \) over \( 3 \, \text{seconds} \).  
- **Speed**: The vehicle maintains a constant speed of \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \) throughout, ensuring it exceeds \( 60 \, \text{km/h} \).  

This plan ensures a smooth and safe maneuver around the obstruction.
