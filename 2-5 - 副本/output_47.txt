To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed exceeding 60 km/h, we'll break the maneuver into three phases: transitioning to the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. We'll use the spatial reference system (X, Y), where X is the distance along the road, and Y is the lateral position relative to the lanes.

### Key Assumptions:
1. **Initial Position**: (0.0, 0)
2. **Obstruction Position**: (100, 0)
3. **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5
4. **Initial Velocity**: 72.0 km/h (20 m/s)
5. **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
6. **Time Interval**: 1 second (critical intervals: T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10)

### Phases of the Maneuver:
1. **Phase 1 (T = 0 to T = 3)**: Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
2. **Phase 2 (T = 3 to T = 7)**: Bypass the obstruction while staying in the adjacent lane.
3. **Phase 3 (T = 7 to T = 10)**: Return to the original lane (Y = 0).

### Calculations:
- **Distance traveled per second**: At 20 m/s, the vehicle travels 20 meters each second.
- **Lateral movement**: Assume smooth lane transitions over 3 seconds (Y changes linearly from 0 to -5 and back).

### Route Plan:
| Time (T) | X Position (m) | Y Position (m) | Notes                          |
|----------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| 0        | 0              | 0              | Starting point                 |
| 1        | 20             | -1.67          | Transitioning to adjacent lane |
| 2        | 40             | -3.33          | Transitioning to adjacent lane |
| 3        | 60             | -5             | Fully in adjacent lane         |
| 4        | 80             | -5             | Bypassing obstruction          |
| 5        | 100            | -5             | Bypassing obstruction          |
| 6        | 120            | -5             | Bypassing obstruction          |
| 7        | 140            | -3.33          | Returning to original lane     |
| 8        | 160            | -1.67          | Returning to original lane     |
| 9        | 180            | 0              | Fully back in original lane    |
| 10       | 200            | 0              | Maneuver complete              |

### Explanation:
1. **Phase 1 (T = 0 to T = 3)**:
   - The vehicle transitions from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds while moving forward at 20 m/s.
   - X increases by 20 meters each second, and Y changes linearly.

2. **Phase 2 (T = 3 to T = 7)**:
   - The vehicle stays in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) and bypasses the obstruction at X = 100.
   - X increases by 20 meters each second.

3. **Phase 3 (T = 7 to T = 10)**:
   - The vehicle transitions back to the original lane (Y = 0) over 3 seconds while continuing to move forward at 20 m/s.
   - Y changes linearly back to 0.

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed exceeding 60 km/h throughout the maneuver while safely navigating around the obstruction.
