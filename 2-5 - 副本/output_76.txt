To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the vehicle's movement into critical intervals. We'll calculate the vehicle's position (X, Y) at each second, ensuring the speed remains above 60 km/h and the lane transitions are smooth.

### Given:
- **Initial position**: (0.0, 0)
- **Obstruction position**: (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5
- **Initial velocity**: 72.0 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)

### Assumptions:
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
2. The lane change is executed linearly over a short distance.
3. The vehicle spends a brief period in the adjacent lane to bypass the obstruction.

### Route Planning:

#### Step 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)
- **Time**: T = 0 to T = 2 seconds
- **Distance traveled**: 20 m/s * 2 s = 40 m
- **Lateral movement**: From Y = 0 to Y = -5 (linear transition)
- **Positions**:
  - T = 1 s: (20, -2.5)
  - T = 2 s: (40, -5)

#### Step 2: Bypass the Obstruction in the Adjacent Lane
- **Time**: T = 2 to T = 5 seconds
- **Distance traveled**: 20 m/s * 3 s = 60 m
- **Lateral movement**: Y remains at -5
- **Positions**:
  - T = 3 s: (60, -5)
  - T = 4 s: (80, -5)
  - T = 5 s: (100, -5)

#### Step 3: Lane Change Back to Original Lane (Y = 0)
- **Time**: T = 5 to T = 7 seconds
- **Distance traveled**: 20 m/s * 2 s = 40 m
- **Lateral movement**: From Y = -5 to Y = 0 (linear transition)
- **Positions**:
  - T = 6 s: (120, -2.5)
  - T = 7 s: (140, 0)

#### Step 4: Continue in Original Lane
- **Time**: T = 7 to T = 10 seconds
- **Distance traveled**: 20 m/s * 3 s = 60 m
- **Lateral movement**: Y remains at 0
- **Positions**:
  - T = 8 s: (160, 0)
  - T = 9 s: (180, 0)
  - T = 10 s: (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions:
- T = 0 s: (0, 0)
- T = 1 s: (20, -2.5)
- T = 2 s: (40, -5)
- T = 3 s: (60, -5)
- T = 4 s: (80, -5)
- T = 5 s: (100, -5)
- T = 6 s: (120, -2.5)
- T = 7 s: (140, 0)
- T = 8 s: (160, 0)
- T = 9 s: (180, 0)
- T = 10 s: (200, 0)

### Key Points:
- The vehicle successfully bypasses the obstruction at X = 100 m by transitioning to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) and then returning to the original lane (Y = 0).
- The speed remains constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h), ensuring it stays above the minimum required speed of 16.67 m/s (60 km/h).
- The lane changes are executed smoothly over 2 seconds each, ensuring safety and stability.
