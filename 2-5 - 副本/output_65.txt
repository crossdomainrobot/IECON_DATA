To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we need to break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**  

### Assumptions:
- Initial speed: 72.0 km/h = 20 m/s  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane)  
- Obstruction is at (100, 0)  
- Lane change duration: 2 seconds (smooth transition)  
- Time step: 1 second  

### Steps:
1. **Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2):**  
   - Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.  
   - Lateral velocity: \( \frac{5 \text{ m}}{2 \text{ s}} = 2.5 \text{ m/s} \)  
   - Forward velocity: 20 m/s (constant during lane change).  

2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6):**  
   - Continue in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until X > 100.  
   - Forward velocity: 20 m/s.  

3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8):**  
   - Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.  
   - Lateral velocity: \( \frac{5 \text{ m}}{2 \text{ s}} = 2.5 \text{ m/s} \)  
   - Forward velocity: 20 m/s (constant during lane change).

| T = 9    | 180.0                | 0.0                  | Continuing forward                   |
| T = 10   | 200.0                | 0.0                  | Continuing forward                   |

### Explanation:
- **X-coordinate:** Increases linearly at 20 m/s (72 km/h).  
- **Y-coordinate:** Changes smoothly during lane transitions (T = 0-2 and T = 6-8).  
- **Obstruction Bypass:** The vehicle stays in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) from T = 2 to T = 6, ensuring it avoids the obstruction at X = 100.  
- **Speed:** Maintained above 60 km/h throughout the maneuver.  

This plan ensures a safe and efficient navigation around the obstruction.
