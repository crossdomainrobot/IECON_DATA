To navigate around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we'll plan a smooth lane transition, bypass, and return to the original lane. Here¡¯s the step-by-step route planning:

### Assumptions:
- **Initial Position**: (0, 0)  
- **Obstruction Position**: (100, 0)  
- **Adjacent Lane Position**: Y = -5  
- **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h (20 m/s)  
- **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)  
- **Time Interval**: 1 second  

### Plan:
1. **Lane Transition**: Gradually move to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) by T = 3 seconds.  
2. **Bypass Obstruction**: Stay in the adjacent lane until X > 100 (by T = 6 seconds).  
3. **Return to Original Lane**: Gradually move back to the original lane (Y = 0) by T = 9 seconds.  

### Calculations:
- **Distance traveled per second**: 20 meters (constant speed).  
- **Lateral movement**: Smooth transition over 3 seconds, moving at a rate of -5/3 ¡Ö -1.67 m/s laterally.  

### Position Estimates:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) | Description                          |
|----------|-------|-------|--------------------------------------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     | Starting position                    |
| 1        | 20    | -1.67 | Transitioning to adjacent lane       |
| 2        | 40    | -3.33 | Transitioning to adjacent lane       |
| 3        | 60    | -5    | Fully in adjacent lane               |
| 4        | 80    | -5    | Approaching obstruction              |
| 5        | 100   | -5    | Bypassing obstruction                |
| 6        | 120   | -5    | Past obstruction, staying in lane    |
| 7        | 140   | -3.33 | Transitioning back to original lane  |
| 8        | 160   | -1.67 | Transitioning back to original lane  |
| 9        | 180   | 0     | Fully back in original lane          |
| 10       | 200   | 0     | Continuing in original lane          |

### Notes:
- The speed is maintained at 72 km/h throughout.  
- Lateral movements are smooth and completed within 3 seconds for each transition.  
- The obstruction is bypassed safely by staying in the adjacent lane from T = 3 to T = 6.  

This plan ensures you navigate around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
