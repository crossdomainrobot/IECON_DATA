To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the vehicle's movement into critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. We'll calculate the vehicle's position (X, Y) at each second, ensuring the speed remains above 60 km/h and the lane transitions are smooth.

### Given:
- **Initial position**: (0.0, 0)
- **Obstruction position**: (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5
- **Initial velocity**: 72.0 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)

### Assumptions:
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
2. The lane change is instantaneous at the specified times.
3. The vehicle moves in a straight line along the X-axis unless changing lanes.

### Route Planning:
1. **T = 0 s**: Starting position (0, 0)
2. **T = 1 s**: (20, 0)
3. **T = 2 s**: (40, 0)
4. **T = 3 s**: (60, 0)
5. **T = 4 s**: (80, 0)
6. **T = 5 s**: (100, 0) ！ At this point, the vehicle detects the obstruction and begins the lane change.
7. **T = 6 s**: (120, -5) ！ Vehicle has moved into the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
8. **T = 7 s**: (140, -5)
9. **T = 8 s**: (160, -5)
10. **T = 9 s**: (180, -5)
11. **T = 10 s**: (200, -5) ！ Vehicle continues in the adjacent lane, having bypassed the obstruction.

### Detailed Positions:
- **T = 0 s**: (0, 0)
- **T = 1 s**: (20, 0)
- **T = 2 s**: (40, 0)
- **T = 3 s**: (60, 0)
- **T = 4 s**: (80, 0)
- **T = 5 s**: (100, 0) ！ Obstruction detected, begin lane change.
- **T = 6 s**: (120, -5) ！ Lane change complete.
- **T = 7 s**: (140, -5)
- **T = 8 s**: (160, -5)
- **T = 9 s**: (180, -5)
- **T = 10 s**: (200, -5)

### Summary:
- The vehicle travels straight along the X-axis for the first 5 seconds, reaching the obstruction at (100, 0).
- At T = 5 s, the vehicle begins the lane change and completes it by T = 6 s, moving to Y = -5.
- The vehicle continues in the adjacent lane for the remaining time, ensuring the obstruction is bypassed.

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h and successfully navigates around the obstruction.
