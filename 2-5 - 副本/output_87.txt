To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the vehicle's movement into critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. We'll calculate the vehicle's position (X, Y) at each second, ensuring the speed remains above 60 km/h and the lane transitions are smooth.

### Given:
- **Initial position**: (0.0, 0)
- **Obstruction position**: (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5
- **Initial velocity**: 72.0 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)

### Assumptions:
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
2. The lane change is executed linearly over a short distance.
3. The obstruction is bypassed by moving into the adjacent lane (Y = -5) and then returning to the original lane (Y = 0).

### Route Planning:
We'll outline the vehicle's position (X, Y) at each second (T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10).

#### Step 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)
- **Time**: T = 0 to T = 2 seconds
- **Distance traveled**: 20 m/s * 2 s = 40 m
- **Lateral movement**: From Y = 0 to Y = -5 (linear transition)

#### Step 2: Bypass the Obstruction (X = 100)
- **Time**: T = 2 to T = 5 seconds
- **Distance traveled**: 20 m/s * 3 s = 60 m
- **Lateral position**: Y = -5 (stays in the adjacent lane)

#### Step 3: Lane Change Back to Original Lane (Y = 0)
- **Time**: T = 5 to T = 7 seconds
- **Distance traveled**: 20 m/s * 2 s = 40 m
- **Lateral movement**: From Y = -5 to Y = 0 (linear transition)

#### Step 4: Continue in Original Lane
- **Time**: T = 7 to T = 10 seconds
- **Distance traveled**: 20 m/s * 3 s = 60 m
- **Lateral position**: Y = 0 (stays in the original lane)

### Vehicle Positions at Critical Intervals:
- **T = 0 s**: (0.0, 0)
- **T = 1 s**: (20.0, -2.5) (midway during lane change)
- **T = 2 s**: (40.0, -5) (fully in adjacent lane)
- **T = 3 s**: (60.0, -5)
- **T = 4 s**: (80.0, -5)
- **T = 5 s**: (100.0, -5) (bypassing obstruction)
- **T = 6 s**: (120.0, -2.5) (midway during lane change back)
- **T = 7 s**: (140.0, 0) (fully back in original lane)
- **T = 8 s**: (160.0, 0)
- **T = 9 s**: (180.0, 0)
- **T = 10 s**: (200.0, 0)

### Summary:
- The vehicle changes lanes between T = 0 to T = 2 seconds and T = 5 to T = 7 seconds.
- The obstruction is bypassed at T = 5 seconds (X = 100, Y = -5).
- The vehicle returns to the original lane by T = 7 seconds and continues traveling in the original lane.

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed above 60 km/h and safely navigates around the obstruction.
