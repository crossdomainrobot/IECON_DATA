To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).**
2. **Bypass the obstruction (X = 100) while staying in the adjacent lane.**
3. **Return to the original lane (Y = 0).**

### Assumptions:
- Initial velocity: \( 72.0 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \).
- Speed must exceed \( 60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \).
- Lane width: \( 5 \, \text{m} \) (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).
- Time step: \( 1 \, \text{second} \).

### Step-by-Step Plan:

#### Phase 1: Transition to the Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2)
- At \( T = 0 \): Start at \( (0, 0) \).
- At \( T = 1 \): Begin transitioning to the adjacent lane. Assume a smooth lateral movement over 2 seconds.
  - \( X = 20 \, \text{m} \), \( Y = -2.5 \, \text{m} \).
- At \( T = 2 \): Complete transition to the adjacent lane.
  - \( X = 40 \, \text{m} \), \( Y = -5 \, \text{m} \).

#### Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 5)
- At \( T = 3 \): Continue in the adjacent lane.
  - \( X = 60 \, \text{m} \), \( Y = -5 \, \text{m} \).
- At \( T = 4 \): Continue in the adjacent lane.
  - \( X = 80 \, \text{m} \), \( Y = -5 \, \text{m} \).
- At \( T = 5 \): Bypass the obstruction.
  - \( X = 100 \, \text{m} \), \( Y = -5 \, \text{m} \).

#### Phase 3: Return to the Original Lane (T = 5 to T = 7)
- At \( T = 6 \): Begin transitioning back to the original lane.
  - \( X = 120 \, \text{m} \), \( Y = -2.5 \, \text{m} \).
- At \( T = 7 \): Complete transition back to the original lane.
  - \( X = 140 \, \text{m} \), \( Y = 0 \, \text{m} \).

### Summary of Positions:
- \( T = 0 \): \( (0, 0) \)
- \( T = 1 \): \( (20, -2.5) \)
- \( T = 2 \): \( (40, -5) \)
- \( T = 3 \): \( (60, -5) \)
- \( T = 4 \): \( (80, -5) \)
- \( T = 5 \): \( (100, -5) \)
- \( T = 6 \): \( (120, -2.5) \)
- \( T = 7 \): \( (140, 0) \)

This plan ensures that the vehicle remains above the minimum speed of \( 60 \, \text{km/h} \) throughout the maneuver and safely navigates around the obstruction.
