To navigate around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we need to plan the lane transitions carefully. Here¡¯s a step-by-step route planning based on the given spatial reference system and constraints:

---

### **Given:**
- **Initial Position:** (X, Y) = (0.0, 0)  
- **Obstruction Position:** (X, Y) = (100, 0)  
- **Adjacent Lane:** Y = -5  
- **Initial Velocity:** 72.0 km/h (20 m/s)  
- **Minimum Speed:** 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)  
- **Time Interval:** 10 seconds  

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle moves at a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h).  
2. Lane transitions are smooth and take 2 seconds each (1 second to move from Y = 0 to Y = -5 and 1 second to return).  
3. The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while bypassing the obstruction (X = 100).  

---

### **Route Plan:**

#### **1. Initial Movement (T = 0 to T = 4 seconds):**
   - The vehicle continues in the outer lane (Y = 0) until it approaches the obstruction.  
   - At T = 4 seconds, the vehicle starts transitioning to the adjacent lane.  

   **Positions:**  
   - T = 0: (0, 0)  
   - T = 1: (20, 0)  
   - T = 2: (40, 0)  
   - T = 3: (60, 0)  
   - T = 4: (80, 0)  

#### **2. Lane Transition (T = 4 to T = 6 seconds):**
   - The vehicle moves from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.  
   - During this time, it continues moving forward at 20 m/s.  

   **Positions:**  
   - T = 5: (100, -2.5)  
   - T = 6: (120, -5)  

#### **3. Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds):**
   - The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while bypassing the obstruction.  
   - It continues moving forward at 20 m/s.  

   **Positions:**  
   - T = 7: (140, -5)  
   - T = 8: (160, -5)  

#### **4. Lane Return (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds):**
   - The vehicle transitions back to the outer lane (Y = 0) over 2 seconds.  
   - It continues moving forward at 20 m/s.  

   **Positions:**  
   - T = 9: (180, -2.5)  
   - T = 10: (200, 0)

### **Summary of Positions:**
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| 0        | (0, 0)          |  
| 1        | (20, 0)         |  
| 2        | (40, 0)         |  
| 3        | (60, 0)         |  
| 4        | (80, 0)         |  
| 5        | (100, -2.5)     |  
| 6        | (120, -5)       |  
| 7        | (140, -5)       |  
| 8        | (160, -5)       |  
| 9        | (180, -2.5)     |  
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

### **Key Points:**
1. The vehicle bypasses the obstruction by transitioning to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) and remains there while passing X = 100.  
2. The speed remains constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h), ensuring it stays above the minimum speed of 16.67 m/s (60 km/h).  
3. The lane transitions are smooth and take 2 seconds each.
