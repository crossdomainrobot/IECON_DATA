To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change Phase**: Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
2. **Bypass Phase**: Travel in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) to bypass the obstruction at X = 100.
3. **Return Phase**: Transition back to the original lane (Y = 0).

### Assumptions:
- Initial velocity: 72.0 km/h (20 m/s).
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s).
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).
- Obstruction is at X = 100 meters.
- Time intervals: 1 second (T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10).

### Step-by-Step Plan:

#### Phase 1: Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)
- **Objective**: Move from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
- **Distance traveled along X**: 20 m/s * 2 s = 40 meters.
- **Lateral movement**: Smooth transition over 2 seconds.
- **Positions**:
  - T = 0: (0, 0)
  - T = 1: (20, -2.5)
  - T = 2: (40, -5)

#### Phase 2: Bypass (T = 2 to T = 6 seconds)
- **Objective**: Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) and bypass the obstruction at X = 100.
- **Distance traveled along X**: 20 m/s * 4 s = 80 meters.
- **Positions**:
  - T = 2: (40, -5)
  - T = 3: (60, -5)
  - T = 4: (80, -5)
  - T = 5: (100, -5)
  - T = 6: (120, -5)

#### Phase 3: Return (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)
- **Objective**: Move from Y = -5 back to Y = 0.
- **Distance traveled along X**: 20 m/s * 2 s = 40 meters.
- **Lateral movement**: Smooth transition over 2 seconds.
- **Positions**:
  - T = 6: (120, -5)
  - T = 7: (140, -2.5)
  - T = 8: (160, 0)

#### Final Phase: Continue in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds)
- **Objective**: Continue traveling in the original lane (Y = 0).
- **Distance traveled along X**: 20 m/s * 2 s = 40 meters.
- **Positions**:
  - T = 8: (160, 0)
  - T = 9: (180, 0)
  - T = 10: (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|-----------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)          |
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |
| 2        | (40, -5)        |
| 3        | (60, -5)        |
| 4        | (80, -5)        |
| 5        | (100, -5)       |
| 6        | (120, -5)       |
| 7        | (140, -2.5)     |
| 8        | (160, 0)        |
| 9        | (180, 0)        |
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h and completes the lane transitions smoothly within 10 seconds.
