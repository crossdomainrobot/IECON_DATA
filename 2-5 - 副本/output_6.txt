To create a route plan for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we'll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypass the obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Return to the original lane (Y = 0)**  

### Assumptions:
- Initial speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s)  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane)  
- Obstruction at X = 100 meters  
- Time step: 1 second  

### Phase 1: Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5)  
We¡¯ll assume the lane change takes **3 seconds**. During this time, the vehicle moves laterally while maintaining forward motion.  

### Phase 2: Bypass the obstruction (X = 100)  
The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane until it has passed the obstruction at X = 100 meters.  

### Phase 3: Return to the original lane (Y = 0)  
After bypassing the obstruction, the vehicle transitions back to the original lane, taking another **3 seconds**.  

### Position Estimates:  
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at each second.  

#### Calculations:  
- Forward motion:  
  \( X = X_{\text{initial}} + \text{velocity} \times \text{time} \)  
  Velocity is maintained at 20 m/s.  

- Lateral motion:  
  During lane changes, the vehicle moves laterally at a constant rate.  

#### Positions:  
- **T = 0 s**: (0, 0)  
- **T = 1 s**: (20, -1.67)  
- **T = 2 s**: (40, -3.33)  
- **T = 3 s**: (60, -5)  
- **T = 4 s**: (80, -5)  
- **T = 5 s**: (100, -5)  
- **T = 6 s**: (120, -5)  
- **T = 7 s**: (140, -3.33)  
- **T = 8 s**: (160, -1.67)  
- **T = 9 s**: (180, 0)  
- **T = 10 s**: (200, 0)  

### Summary of Positions:  
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| 0        | (0, 0)          |  
| 1        | (20, -1.67)     |  
| 2        | (40, -3.33)     |  
| 3        | (60, -5)        |  
| 4        | (80, -5)        |  
| 5        | (100, -5)       |  
| 6        | (120, -5)       |  
| 7        | (140, -3.33)    |  
| 8        | (160, -1.67)    |  
| 9        | (180, 0)        |  
| 10       | (200, 0)        |  

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
