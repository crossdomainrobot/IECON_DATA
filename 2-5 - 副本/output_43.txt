To plan the route and estimate the vehicle¡¯s position at critical intervals, we¡¯ll follow these steps:

1. **Convert speed to meters per second (m/s):**
   - Initial speed: \( 72.0 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \)
   - Minimum speed: \( 60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \)

2. **Define the trajectory:**
   - Transition to the adjacent lane (\( Y = -5 \)) before reaching the obstruction at \( X = 100 \).
   - Bypass the obstruction and return to the original lane (\( Y = 0 \)).

3. **Time to reach the obstruction:**
   - Distance to obstruction: \( 100 \, \text{m} \)
   - Time at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \): \( t = \frac{100}{20} = 5 \, \text{seconds} \)

4. **Plan the lane transitions:**
   - Start transitioning to the adjacent lane at \( T = 1 \) and complete by \( T = 3 \).
   - Stay in the adjacent lane until \( T = 7 \), then transition back to the original lane by \( T = 9 \).

5. **Estimate positions at 1-second intervals:**

   | Time (s) | X-coordinate (m) | Y-coordinate (m) | Description                        |
   |----------|------------------|------------------|------------------------------------|
   | 0        | 0.0              | 0.0              | Starting position                  |
   | 1        | 20               | -1.67            | Begin lane transition              |
   | 2        | 40               | -3.33            | Midway in lane transition          |
   | 3        | 60               | -5.0             | Fully in adjacent lane             |
   | 4        | 80               | -5.0             | Approaching obstruction            |
   | 5        | 100              | -5.0             | Bypassing obstruction              |
   | 6        | 120              | -5.0             | Past obstruction                   |
   | 7        | 140              | -3.33            | Begin returning to original lane   |
   | 8        | 160              | -1.67            | Midway in return transition        |
   | 9        | 180              | 0.0              | Fully back in original lane        |
   | 10       | 200              | 0.0              | Continue in original lane          |

6. **Key assumptions:**
   - Speed remains constant at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).
   - Lane transitions are smooth and linear.

This plan ensures the vehicle navigates around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above \( 60 \, \text{km/h} \).
