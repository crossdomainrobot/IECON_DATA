To navigate around the obstruction while maintaining a speed exceeding 60 km/h, we¡¯ll plan the lane transitions and calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at 1-second intervals. Here¡¯s the step-by-step route planning:

---

### **Given:**
- Starting position: (0, 0)
- Obstruction position: (100, 0)
- Adjacent lane Y-coordinate: Y = -5
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- Time interval: 1 second

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
2. Lane transitions are smooth and instantaneous for simplicity.
3. The vehicle starts moving to the adjacent lane at T = 1 second and returns to the original lane after bypassing the obstruction.

---

### **Route Planning:**

#### **1. Lane Transition to Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):**
- Start transitioning at T = 1 second.
- Complete transition by T = 2 second.

#### **2. Bypass the Obstruction:**
- Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until the vehicle passes X = 100.

#### **3. Lane Transition Back to Original Lane (Y = 0):**
- Start transitioning back at T = 6 second.
- Complete transition by T = 7 second.

### **Position Estimates:**

| Time (s) | X (m)       | Y (m)       | Description                           |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| T = 0    | 0.0         | 0.0         | Starting position.                    |
| T = 1    | 20.0        | 0.0         | Begin transition to adjacent lane.    |
| T = 2    | 40.0        | -5.0        | Complete transition to adjacent lane. |
| T = 3    | 60.0        | -5.0        | Continue in adjacent lane.            |
| T = 4    | 80.0        | -5.0        | Continue in adjacent lane.            |
| T = 5    | 100.0       | -5.0        | Bypass the obstruction.               |
| T = 6    | 120.0       | -5.0        | Begin transition back to original lane.|
| T = 7    | 140.0       | 0.0         | Complete transition to original lane. |
| T = 8    | 160.0       | 0.0         | Continue in original lane.            |
| T = 9    | 180.0       | 0.0         | Continue in original lane.            |
| T = 10   | 200.0       | 0.0         | Continue in original lane.            |

### **Explanation:**
1. **Lane Transition:** The vehicle moves from Y = 0 to Y = -5 between T = 1 and T = 2 seconds.
2. **Bypassing Obstruction:** The vehicle stays in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until it passes the obstruction at X = 100 (T = 5 seconds).
3. **Return to Original Lane:** The vehicle transitions back to Y = 0 between T = 6 and T = 7 seconds.
4. **Continued Travel:** The vehicle continues in the original lane (Y = 0) after T = 7 seconds.

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction safely while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
