To navigate around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll plan the lane transitions and estimate the vehicle¡¯s position at critical intervals. Here¡¯s the step-by-step route planning:

---

### **Assumptions and Setup**
1. **Initial Position**: (X, Y) = (0.0, 0) at T = 0.
2. **Obstruction Location**: (X, Y) = (100, 0).
3. **Adjacent Lane**: Y = -5.
4. **Initial Speed**: 72.0 km/h = 20 m/s.
5. **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s.
6. **Time Intervals**: We¡¯ll calculate positions every 1 second for 10 seconds.

---

### **Route Plan**
1. **Lane Transition**: Move from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds (smooth transition).
2. **Bypass Obstruction**: Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until X > 100.
3. **Return to Original Lane**: Move from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.

### **Position Calculations**
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position at T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 seconds. The vehicle moves at a constant speed of 20 m/s along the X-axis unless transitioning lanes.

#### **Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2)**
- At T = 0: (X, Y) = (0, 0).
- At T = 1: (X, Y) = (20, -2.5).
- At T = 2: (X, Y) = (40, -5).

#### **Bypassing Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6)**
- At T = 3: (X, Y) = (60, -5).
- At T = 4: (X, Y) = (80, -5).
- At T = 5: (X, Y) = (100, -5).
- At T = 6: (X, Y) = (120, -5).

#### **Return to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8)**
- At T = 7: (X, Y) = (140, -2.5).
- At T = 8: (X, Y) = (160, 0).

#### **Continue in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10)**
- At T = 9: (X, Y) = (180, 0).
- At T = 10: (X, Y) = (200, 0).

### **Summary of Positions**
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |
| 2        | 40    | -5    |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |
| 8        | 160   | 0     |
| 9        | 180   | 0     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### **Explanation**
1. **Lane Transition**: The vehicle smoothly transitions to the adjacent lane over 2 seconds.
2. **Bypassing Obstruction**: The vehicle stays in the adjacent lane until it clears the obstruction at X = 100.
3. **Return to Original Lane**: The vehicle transitions back to the original lane over 2 seconds.
4. **Speed**: The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h), ensuring it stays above the minimum speed of 60 km/h.

This plan ensures safe navigation around the obstruction while adhering to speed constraints.
