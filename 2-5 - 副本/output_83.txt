To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**  

### Assumptions:
- Initial velocity: \( 72.0 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- Minimum speed: \( 60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- Lane width: \( 5 \, \text{m} \) (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane)  
- Obstruction at \( X = 100 \, \text{m} \)  
- Time step: \( 1 \, \text{second} \)  

### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)
- Duration: \( 3 \, \text{seconds} \)  
- Lateral movement: \( Y \) transitions from \( 0 \) to \( -5 \) linearly over \( 3 \, \text{seconds} \).  
- Longitudinal movement: \( X \) increases at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -1.67 |
| 2        | 40    | -3.33 |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)
- Duration: \( 2 \, \text{seconds} \)  
- Lateral position: \( Y = -5 \) (remain in the adjacent lane).  
- Longitudinal movement: \( X \) increases at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |

### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)
- Duration: \( 3 \, \text{seconds} \)  
- Lateral movement: \( Y \) transitions from \( -5 \) to \( 0 \) linearly over \( 3 \, \text{seconds} \).  
- Longitudinal movement: \( X \) increases at \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).  

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 6        | 120   | -3.33 |
| 7        | 140   | -1.67 |
| 8        | 160   | 0     |

### Summary of Positions Over 10 Seconds:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -1.67 |
| 2        | 40    | -3.33 |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -3.33 |
| 7        | 140   | -1.67 |
| 8        | 160   | 0     |
| 9        | 180   | 0     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### Key Points:
- The vehicle maintains a speed of \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \) throughout.  
- The lane changes are smooth and linear, ensuring safety and stability.  
- The obstruction is bypassed successfully by staying in the adjacent lane from \( X = 60 \, \text{m} \) to \( X = 100 \, \text{m} \).
