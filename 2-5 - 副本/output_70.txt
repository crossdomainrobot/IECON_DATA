To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the movement into three phases: transitioning to the adjacent lane, bypassing the obstruction, and returning to the original lane. Here¡¯s the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Assumptions and Initial Conditions**
1. **Initial Position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
2. **Obstruction Position**: (X, Y) = (100, 0)
3. **Adjacent Lane Position**: Y = -5
4. **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s
5. **Minimum Speed Constraint**: > 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s
6. **Time Interval**: 10 seconds, broken into 1-second steps

---

### **Phase 1: Transition to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)**
- **Objective**: Move from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
- **Lateral Speed**: Assume a smooth transition over 3 seconds, so lateral velocity = (5 m) / (3 s) ¡Ö 1.67 m/s.
- **Forward Speed**: Maintain 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m)        | Y (m)        |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| 0        | 0            | 0            |
| 1        | 20           | -1.67        |
| 2        | 40           | -3.33        |
| 3        | 60           | -5           |

---

### **Phase 2: Bypass the Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7 seconds)**
- **Objective**: Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while passing the obstruction at X = 100.
- **Forward Speed**: Maintain 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m)        | Y (m)        |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| 4        | 80           | -5           |
| 5        | 100          | -5           |
| 6        | 120          | -5           |
| 7        | 140          | -5           |

---

### **Phase 3: Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10 seconds)**
- **Objective**: Move from Y = -5 back to Y = 0.
- **Lateral Speed**: Assume a smooth transition over 3 seconds, so lateral velocity = (5 m) / (3 s) ¡Ö 1.67 m/s.
- **Forward Speed**: Maintain 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m)        | Y (m)        |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| 8        | 160          | -3.33        |
| 9        | 180          | -1.67        |
| 10       | 200          | 0            |

### **Summary of Positions**
| Time (s) | X (m)        | Y (m)        |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| 0        | 0            | 0            |
| 1        | 20           | -1.67        |
| 2        | 40           | -3.33        |
| 3        | 60           | -5           |
| 4        | 80           | -5           |
| 5        | 100          | -5           |
| 6        | 120          | -5           |
| 7        | 140          | -5           |
| 8        | 160          | -3.33        |
| 9        | 180          | -1.67        |
| 10       | 200          | 0            |

### **Key Points**
1. The vehicle successfully bypasses the obstruction at X = 100 while staying in the adjacent lane.
2. The speed remains above 60 km/h throughout the maneuver.
3. The lateral transitions are smooth and completed within the 10-second timeframe.
