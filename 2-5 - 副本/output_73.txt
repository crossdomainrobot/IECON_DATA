To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we'll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**  

### Assumptions:
- **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h = 20 m/s (constant speed).  
- **Obstruction**: Located at (100, 0).  
- **Lane Width**: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).  
- **Time Interval**: 10 seconds total, with critical points at T = 1, 2, ..., 10 seconds.  

### Phase 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)  
Assume the lane change takes **3 seconds** and is completed by T = 3.  
- At T = 0: Position = (0, 0).  
- At T = 1: Position = (20, -1.67).  
- At T = 2: Position = (40, -3.33).  
- At T = 3: Position = (60, -5).  

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)  
From T = 3 to T = 7, the vehicle travels in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) and bypasses the obstruction at X = 100.  
- At T = 4: Position = (80, -5).  
- At T = 5: Position = (100, -5).  
- At T = 6: Position = (120, -5).  
- At T = 7: Position = (140, -5).  

### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to Original Lane (Y = 0)  
Assume the lane change back takes **3 seconds** and is completed by T = 10.  
- At T = 8: Position = (160, -3.33).  
- At T = 9: Position = (180, -1.67).  
- At T = 10: Position = (200, 0).  

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| 0        | (0, 0)          |  
| 1        | (20, -1.67)     |  
| 2        | (40, -3.33)     |  
| 3        | (60, -5)        |  
| 4        | (80, -5)        |  
| 5        | (100, -5)       |  
| 6        | (120, -5)       |  
| 7        | (140, -5)       |  
| 8        | (160, -3.33)    |  
| 9        | (180, -1.67)    |  
| 10       | (200, 0)        |  

This plan ensures the vehicle maintains a speed of 72 km/h throughout, successfully bypasses the obstruction, and returns to the original lane within 10 seconds.
