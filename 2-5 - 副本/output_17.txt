To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into phases: **lane transition**, **bypassing the obstruction**, and **returning to the original lane**. Here¡¯s the step-by-step plan:

### **Assumptions and Given Data**
1. **Starting Point**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
2. **Obstruction Location**: (100, 0)
3. **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5
4. **Initial Velocity**: 72 km/h (20 m/s)
5. **Minimum Speed**: Must exceed 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
6. **Time Interval**: 10 seconds, with critical positions at T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10.

### **Phase 1: Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 3)**
- **Objective**: Move from Y = 0 to Y = -5 (adjacent lane).
- **Time Allocation**: 3 seconds for smooth lateral transition.
- **Lateral Velocity**: ¦¤Y = -5 m over 3 seconds ¡ú Lateral velocity = -5/3 ¡Ö -1.67 m/s.
- **Forward Motion**: Maintain speed of 20 m/s.
- **Positions**:
  - T = 1: X = 20, Y = -1.67
  - T = 2: X = 40, Y = -3.33
  - T = 3: X = 60, Y = -5

---

### **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7)**
- **Objective**: Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while bypassing the obstruction at X = 100.
- **Time Allocation**: 4 seconds to ensure the obstruction is safely passed.
- **Forward Motion**: Maintain speed of 20 m/s.
- **Positions**:
  - T = 4: X = 80, Y = -5
  - T = 5: X = 100, Y = -5
  - T = 6: X = 120, Y = -5
  - T = 7: X = 140, Y = -5

---

### **Phase 3: Returning to the Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10)**
- **Objective**: Move from Y = -5 back to Y = 0 (original lane).
- **Time Allocation**: 3 seconds for smooth lateral transition.
- **Lateral Velocity**: ¦¤Y = +5 m over 3 seconds ¡ú Lateral velocity = +5/3 ¡Ö +1.67 m/s.
- **Forward Motion**: Maintain speed of 20 m/s.
- **Positions**:
  - T = 8: X = 160, Y = -3.33
  - T = 9: X = 180, Y = -1.67
  - T = 10: X = 200, Y = 0

### **Summary of Positions**
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -1.67 |
| 2        | 40    | -3.33 |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -5    |
| 8        | 160   | -3.33 |
| 9        | 180   | -1.67 |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### **Verification**
1. **Speed**: The forward speed is maintained at 20 m/s (72 km/h), which exceeds the minimum requirement of 60 km/h.
2. **Obstruction Bypass**: The vehicle stays in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) from T = 3 to T = 7, ensuring the obstruction at X = 100 is safely bypassed.
3. **Smooth Transitions**: Lateral movements are gradual, ensuring stability and safety.

This plan ensures the vehicle navigates around the obstruction while maintaining speed and smooth lane transitions.
