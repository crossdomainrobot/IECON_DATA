To plan the route and estimate the vehicle's position at critical intervals, we need to consider the following:

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - Starting position: (0.0, 0)
   - Obstruction position: (100, 0)
   - Adjacent lane Y-coordinate: -5
   - Initial velocity: 72.0 km/h (20 m/s)
   - Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)

2. **Assumptions**:
   - The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 72.0 km/h (20 m/s) throughout the maneuver.
   - The lane change is executed smoothly and takes a reasonable amount of time (e.g., 2 seconds to transition to the adjacent lane and 2 seconds to return to the original lane).

3. **Critical Intervals**:
   - **T = 0 s**: Starting position (0.0, 0)
   - **T = 1 s**: Position after 1 second (20, 0)
   - **T = 2 s**: Position after 2 seconds (40, 0)
   - **T = 3 s**: Begin lane change to the adjacent lane (60, -2.5)
   - **T = 4 s**: Complete lane change to the adjacent lane (80, -5)
   - **T = 5 s**: Position in the adjacent lane (100, -5) (bypassing the obstruction)
   - **T = 6 s**: Position in the adjacent lane (120, -5)
   - **T = 7 s**: Begin lane change back to the original lane (140, -2.5)
   - **T = 8 s**: Complete lane change back to the original lane (160, 0)
   - **T = 9 s**: Position in the original lane (180, 0)
   - **T = 10 s**: Position in the original lane (200, 0)

4. **Detailed Position Estimates**:
   - **T = 0 s**: (0.0, 0)
   - **T = 1 s**: (20, 0)
   - **T = 2 s**: (40, 0)
   - **T = 3 s**: (60, -2.5) (begin lane change)
   - **T = 4 s**: (80, -5) (complete lane change)
   - **T = 5 s**: (100, -5) (bypass obstruction)
   - **T = 6 s**: (120, -5)
   - **T = 7 s**: (140, -2.5) (begin lane change back)
   - **T = 8 s**: (160, 0) (complete lane change back)
   - **T = 9 s**: (180, 0)
   - **T = 10 s**: (200, 0)

This plan ensures that the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h and smoothly transitions between lanes.
