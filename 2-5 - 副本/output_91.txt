To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining speed and transitioning lanes, we¨ll break the process into steps and calculate the vehicle¨s position at critical intervals. Here's the plan:

---

### **Assumptions and Parameters:**
1. **Starting Position**: (X, Y) = (0.0, 0)
2. **Obstruction Position**: (X, Y) = (100, 0)
3. **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5
4. **Initial Velocity**: 72.0 km/h = 20 m/s (converted for ease of calculation)
5. **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s
6. **Time Intervals**: 1-second increments for simplicity
7. **Lane Transition Time**: Assume it takes 2 seconds to transition into the adjacent lane and 2 seconds to return to the original lane.

### **Route Plan:**

#### **1. Approach the Obstruction (T = 0 to T = 4 seconds):**
- **Objective**: Move from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) to bypass the obstruction.
- **Lane Transition**: Start transitioning at T = 1 and complete by T = 3.
- **Position Calculations**:
  - **T = 0**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
  - **T = 1**: (X, Y) = (20, -1.25) ！ Begin lane transition.
  - **T = 2**: (X, Y) = (40, -2.5) ！ Continue lane transition.
  - **T = 3**: (X, Y) = (60, -5) ！ Complete lane transition.
  - **T = 4**: (X, Y) = (80, -5) ！ Continue in the adjacent lane.

---

#### **2. Bypass the Obstruction (T = 4 to T = 6 seconds):**
- **Objective**: Stay in the adjacent lane while passing the obstruction at X = 100.
- **Position Calculations**:
  - **T = 5**: (X, Y) = (100, -5) ！ Reach the obstruction.
  - **T = 6**: (X, Y) = (120, -5) ！ Continue in the adjacent lane.

---

#### **3. Return to the Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds):**
- **Objective**: Transition back to the original lane (Y = 0).
- **Lane Transition**: Start transitioning at T = 6 and complete by T = 8.
- **Position Calculations**:
  - **T = 7**: (X, Y) = (140, -2.5) ！ Begin returning to the original lane.
  - **T = 8**: (X, Y) = (160, 0) ！ Complete lane transition.

---

#### **4. Continue in the Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds):**
- **Objective**: Resume travel in the original lane.
- **Position Calculations**:
  - **T = 9**: (X, Y) = (180, 0)
  - **T = 10**: (X, Y) = (200, 0)

### **Summary of Positions:**
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -1.25 |
| 2        | 40    | -2.5  |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -5    |
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |
| 8        | 160   | 0     |
| 9        | 180   | 0     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### **Key Notes:**
- The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
- Lane transitions are smooth and completed within 2 seconds each.
- The obstruction is bypassed safely while ensuring the vehicle remains in the adjacent lane during the critical period.
