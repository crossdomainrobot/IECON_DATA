To plan the route and estimate the vehicle¡¯s position at critical intervals, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Transition (Y = 0 ¡ú Y = -5)**: Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**: Maintain the adjacent lane (Y = -5) while bypassing the obstruction.
3. **Lane Return (Y = -5 ¡ú Y = 0)**: Transition back to the original lane (Y = 0).

### Assumptions:
- Vehicle speed: 72 km/h (20 m/s).
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).
- Obstacle at X = 100 meters.
- Time interval: 1 second.

---

### Step-by-Step Plan:

#### **Phase 1: Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 2.5 seconds)**
- Goal: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 in 2.5 seconds.
- Lateral velocity: \( \frac{5 \, \text{m}}{2.5 \, \text{s}} = 2 \, \text{m/s} \).

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| T = 0    | 0.0   | 0.0   |
| T = 1    | 20.0  | -2.0  |
| T = 2    | 40.0  | -4.0  |
| T = 2.5  | 50.0  | -5.0  |

---

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2.5 to T = 7.5 seconds)**
- Goal: Maintain Y = -5 while bypassing the obstruction at X = 100.
- Distance to bypass: 50 meters (from X = 50 to X = 100).

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| T = 3    | 60.0  | -5.0  |
| T = 4    | 80.0  | -5.0  |
| T = 5    | 100.0 | -5.0  |
| T = 6    | 120.0 | -5.0  |
| T = 7    | 140.0 | -5.0  |
| T = 7.5  | 150.0 | -5.0  |

---

#### **Phase 3: Lane Return (T = 7.5 to T = 10 seconds)**
- Goal: Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 in 2.5 seconds.
- Lateral velocity: \( \frac{5 \, \text{m}}{2.5 \, \text{s}} = 2 \, \text{m/s} \).

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| T = 8    | 160.0 | -4.0  |
| T = 9    | 180.0 | -2.0  |
| T = 10   | 200.0 | 0.0   |

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed of 72 km/h and completes the lane transitions smoothly.
