To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break the process into key phases:  
1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**  

### Assumptions:  
- Initial position: \( (X, Y) = (0, 0) \)  
- Obstruction position: \( (100, 0) \)  
- Adjacent lane: \( Y = -5 \)  
- Initial velocity: \( 72.0 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- Minimum speed: \( 60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- Time steps: \( T = 1 \, \text{second} \) intervals  

### Steps:  
1. **Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):**  
   - Assume the lane change takes 2 seconds.  
   - Lateral movement: \( Y \) transitions from \( 0 \) to \( -5 \) linearly over 2 seconds.  

2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100):**  
   - Maintain \( Y = -5 \) while passing \( X = 100 \).  

3. **Lane Change Back to Original Lane (Y = 0):**  
   - Assume the lane change takes 2 seconds.  
   - Lateral movement: \( Y \) transitions from \( -5 \) to \( 0 \) linearly over 2 seconds.  

### Position Estimates:  
We calculate \( X \) and \( Y \) at each second:  

#### \( X \)-Coordinate:  
- \( X(t) = X(0) + v \cdot t = 0 + 20 \cdot t \)  

#### \( Y \)-Coordinate:  
- \( T = 0 \, \text{s}: Y = 0 \)  
- \( T = 1 \, \text{s}: Y = -2.5 \) (halfway through lane change)  
- \( T = 2 \, \text{s}: Y = -5 \) (completed lane change)  
- \( T = 3 \, \text{s} \) to \( T = 7 \, \text{s}: Y = -5 \) (bypassing obstruction)  
- \( T = 8 \, \text{s}: Y = -2.5 \) (halfway back to original lane)  
- \( T = 9 \, \text{s}: Y = 0 \) (completed lane change)  

#### Positions at Each Second:  
| \( T \) (s) | \( X \) (m) | \( Y \) (m) |  
|-------------|------------|------------|  
| 0           | 0          | 0          |  
| 1           | 20         | -2.5       |  
| 2           | 40         | -5         |  
| 3           | 60         | -5         |  
| 4           | 80         | -5         |  
| 5           | 100        | -5         |  
| 6           | 120        | -5         |  
| 7           | 140        | -5         |  
| 8           | 160        | -2.5       |  
| 9           | 180        | 0          |  
| 10          | 200        | 0          |  

### Notes:  
- The vehicle maintains a speed of \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \) throughout.  
- The lane changes are smooth and linear over 2 seconds each.  
- The obstruction is bypassed at \( X = 100 \) while in the adjacent lane.  

This plan ensures the vehicle stays above the minimum speed and safely navigates around the obstruction.
