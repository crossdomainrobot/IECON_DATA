To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we need to consider the vehicle's speed, the distance to the obstruction, and the lane change maneuver. Here¡¯s a step-by-step plan:

### Given:
- **Initial Position**: (X, Y) = (0.0, 0)
- **Obstruction Position**: (X, Y) = (100, 0)
- **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5
- **Initial Speed**: 72.0 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum Speed**: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- **Time Intervals**: T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 seconds

### Assumptions:
- The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s.
- The lane change is completed in 2 seconds (a smooth transition).

### Route Planning:

1. **Maintain Lane (T = 0 to T = 3 seconds)**:
   - The vehicle continues in the outer lane (Y = 0) until T = 3 seconds.
   - **Position at T = 3 seconds**: (X, Y) = (60, 0)

2. **Begin Lane Change (T = 3 to T = 5 seconds)**:
   - The vehicle starts transitioning to the adjacent lane (Y = -5) over 2 seconds.
   - **Position at T = 4 seconds**: (X, Y) = (80, -2.5)
   - **Position at T = 5 seconds**: (X, Y) = (100, -5)

3. **Bypass Obstruction (T = 5 to T = 7 seconds)**:
   - The vehicle continues in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) to bypass the obstruction at X = 100.
   - **Position at T = 6 seconds**: (X, Y) = (120, -5)
   - **Position at T = 7 seconds**: (X, Y) = (140, -5)

4. **Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 9 seconds)**:
   - The vehicle starts transitioning back to the original lane (Y = 0) over 2 seconds.
   - **Position at T = 8 seconds**: (X, Y) = (160, -2.5)
   - **Position at T = 9 seconds**: (X, Y) = (180, 0)

5. **Continue in Original Lane (T = 9 to T = 10 seconds)**:
   - The vehicle continues in the original lane (Y = 0).
   - **Position at T = 10 seconds**: (X, Y) = (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions:
- **T = 1 second**: (20, 0)
- **T = 2 seconds**: (40, 0)
- **T = 3 seconds**: (60, 0)
- **T = 4 seconds**: (80, -2.5)
- **T = 5 seconds**: (100, -5)
- **T = 6 seconds**: (120, -5)
- **T = 7 seconds**: (140, -5)
- **T = 8 seconds**: (160, -2.5)
- **T = 9 seconds**: (180, 0)
- **T = 10 seconds**: (200, 0)

This plan ensures that the vehicle bypasses the obstruction safely while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
