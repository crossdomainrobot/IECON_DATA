To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we¡¯ll break the maneuver into stages:

1. **Initial Phase (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds):** Begin transitioning to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
2. **Bypass Phase (T = 2 to T = 6 seconds):** Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) to bypass the obstruction.  
3. **Recovery Phase (T = 6 to T = 10 seconds):** Return to the original lane (Y = 0).  

### Assumptions:
- Speed is maintained at 72 km/h (20 m/s) throughout.  
- Lateral movement (lane changes) takes 2 seconds each.  
- The obstruction is at X = 100 meters.  

### Step-by-Step Position Estimates:

#### 1. Initial Phase (Lane Change to Y = -5):  
- **T = 0 seconds:** Starting position: (0, 0).  
- **T = 1 second:** X = 20 m, Y = -2.5 m (halfway through lane change).  
- **T = 2 seconds:** X = 40 m, Y = -5 m (fully in adjacent lane).  

#### 2. Bypass Phase (Stay in Adjacent Lane):  
- **T = 3 seconds:** X = 60 m, Y = -5 m.  
- **T = 4 seconds:** X = 80 m, Y = -5 m.  
- **T = 5 seconds:** X = 100 m, Y = -5 m (bypassing obstruction).  
- **T = 6 seconds:** X = 120 m, Y = -5 m.  

#### 3. Recovery Phase (Return to Y = 0):  
- **T = 7 seconds:** X = 140 m, Y = -2.5 m (halfway through lane change).  
- **T = 8 seconds:** X = 160 m, Y = 0 m (fully back in original lane).  
- **T = 9 seconds:** X = 180 m, Y = 0 m.  
- **T = 10 seconds:** X = 200 m, Y = 0 m.  

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |  
|----------|-------|-------|  
| 0        | 0     | 0     |  
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |  
| 2        | 40    | -5    |  
| 3        | 60    | -5    |  
| 4        | 80    | -5    |  
| 5        | 100   | -5    |  
| 6        | 120   | -5    |  
| 7        | 140   | -2.5  |  
| 8        | 160   | 0     |  
| 9        | 180   | 0     |  
| 10       | 200   | 0     |  

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h and safely returns to the original lane.
