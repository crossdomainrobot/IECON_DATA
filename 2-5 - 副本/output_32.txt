To plan the route around the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we'll break the maneuver into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**  
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**  
3. **Lane Change Back to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**

### Assumptions:
- Initial speed: 72 km/h = 20 m/s (converted for ease of calculation).  
- Lane width: 5 meters (Y = -5 for the adjacent lane).  
- Obstruction is at X = 100 meters.  
- Lane changes take **2 seconds** each.  
- Speed remains constant at 20 m/s throughout the maneuver.

### Critical Intervals:
We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position every second for 10 seconds.

---

### Phase 1: Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)
- **Lateral movement**: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.  
- **Longitudinal movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (T) | X = 20 ¡Á T | Y = -2.5 ¡Á T | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------|--------------|------------------|
| 0        | 0          | 0            | (0, 0)           |
| 1        | 20         | -2.5         | (20, -2.5)       |
| 2        | 40         | -5           | (40, -5)         |

---

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6 seconds)
- **Lateral movement**: Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).  
- **Longitudinal movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.  
- The obstruction is at X = 100 meters, so we¡¯ll bypass it during this phase.

| Time (T) | X = 20 ¡Á T | Y = -5 | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------|--------|------------------|
| 3        | 60         | -5     | (60, -5)         |
| 4        | 80         | -5     | (80, -5)         |
| 5        | 100        | -5     | (100, -5)        |
| 6        | 120        | -5     | (120, -5)        |

---

### Phase 3: Lane Change Back to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)
- **Lateral movement**: Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.  
- **Longitudinal movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (T) | X = 20 ¡Á T | Y = -5 + 2.5 ¡Á (T - 6) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------|------------------------|------------------|
| 6        | 120        | -5                     | (120, -5)        |
| 7        | 140        | -2.5                   | (140, -2.5)      |
| 8        | 160        | 0                      | (160, 0)         |

---

### Final Phase: Continue in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds)
- **Lateral movement**: Stay in the original lane (Y = 0).  
- **Longitudinal movement**: X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (T) | X = 20 ¡Á T | Y = 0 | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------|-------|------------------|
| 9        | 180        | 0     | (180, 0)         |
| 10       | 200        | 0     | (200, 0)         |

### Summary of Positions:
| Time (T) | Position (X, Y) |
|----------|------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)           |
| 1        | (20, -2.5)       |
| 2        | (40, -5)         |
| 3        | (60, -5)         |
| 4        | (80, -5)         |
| 5        | (100, -5)        |
| 6        | (120, -5)        |
| 7        | (140, -2.5)      |
| 8        | (160, 0)         |
| 9        | (180, 0)         |
| 10       | (200, 0)         |

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
