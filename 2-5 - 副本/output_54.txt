To plan your route and ensure a safe lane transition while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we'll break down the process into key intervals. Here's the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Given:**
- **Starting position:** \( (X, Y) = (0.0, 0) \)
- **Obstruction position:** \( (100, 0) \)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate:** \( Y = -5 \)
- **Initial speed:** \( 72.0 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \)
- **Minimum speed:** \( 60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \)
- **Time interval:** \( T = 0 \) to \( T = 10 \, \text{seconds} \)

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. **Lane transition:** The lane change takes **2 seconds** (from \( T = 2 \) to \( T = 4 \)).
2. **Bypassing the obstruction:** You remain in the adjacent lane until \( X > 100 \).
3. **Returning to the original lane:** The return transition takes **2 seconds** (from \( T = 6 \) to \( T = 8 \)).

---

### **Route Plan:**

#### **Phase 1: Initial Movement (\( T = 0 \) to \( T = 2 \))**
- Move forward in the outer lane at a constant speed of \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).
- **Positions:**
  - \( T = 0 \): \( (0, 0) \)
  - \( T = 1 \): \( (20, 0) \)
  - \( T = 2 \): \( (40, 0) \)

#### **Phase 2: Lane Transition (\( T = 2 \) to \( T = 4 \))**
- Transition to the adjacent lane (\( Y = -5 \)) over 2 seconds.
- **Positions:**
  - \( T = 3 \): \( (60, -2.5) \)
  - \( T = 4 \): \( (80, -5) \)

#### **Phase 3: Bypassing Obstruction (\( T = 4 \) to \( T = 6 \))**
- Continue in the adjacent lane at a constant speed of \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).
- **Positions:**
  - \( T = 5 \): \( (100, -5) \)
  - \( T = 6 \): \( (120, -5) \)

#### **Phase 4: Return Transition (\( T = 6 \) to \( T = 8 \))**
- Transition back to the original lane (\( Y = 0 \)) over 2 seconds.
- **Positions:**
  - \( T = 7 \): \( (140, -2.5) \)
  - \( T = 8 \): \( (160, 0) \)

#### **Phase 5: Final Movement (\( T = 8 \) to \( T = 10 \))**
- Continue in the original lane at a constant speed of \( 20 \, \text{m/s} \).
- **Positions:**
  - \( T = 9 \): \( (180, 0) \)
  - \( T = 10 \): \( (200, 0) \)

---

### **Summary of Positions:**
| Time (s) | Position \((X, Y)\) |
|----------|---------------------|
| 0        | (0, 0)              |
| 1        | (20, 0)             |
| 2        | (40, 0)             |
| 3        | (60, -2.5)          |
| 4        | (80, -5)            |
| 5        | (100, -5)           |
| 6        | (120, -5)           |
| 7        | (140, -2.5)         |
| 8        | (160, 0)            |
| 9        | (180, 0)            |
| 10       | (200, 0)            |

### **Key Notes:**
- Speed is maintained above \( 60 \, \text{km/h} \) throughout.
- Lane transitions are smooth and take 2 seconds each.
- The obstruction is bypassed safely by staying in the adjacent lane from \( X = 40 \) to \( X = 120 \).
