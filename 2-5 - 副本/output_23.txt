To plan the route for your vehicle to bypass the obstruction, we'll break down the process into critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. Here¡¯s the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Key Details:**
- **Initial Position:** (X, Y) = (0.0, 0)  
- **Obstruction Position:** (100, 0)  
- **Adjacent Lane Y-Coordinate:** Y = -5  
- **Initial Velocity:** 72.0 km/h = 20 m/s  
- **Minimum Speed Constraint:** > 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s  

---

### **Route Plan:**

1. **Lane Transition to Adjacent Lane (Y = -5):**  
   - Start at T = 0, (0, 0).  
   - Transition to the adjacent lane smoothly over 2 seconds (T = 0 to T = 2).  
   - At T = 1: Position = (20, -2.5)  
   - At T = 2: Position = (40, -5)  

2. **Bypass the Obstruction (X = 100):**  
   - Continue in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until you pass the obstruction.  
   - At T = 3: Position = (60, -5)  
   - At T = 4: Position = (80, -5)  
   - At T = 5: Position = (100, -5)  

3. **Return to Original Lane (Y = 0):**  
   - Transition back to the original lane smoothly over 2 seconds (T = 5 to T = 7).  
   - At T = 6: Position = (120, -2.5)  
   - At T = 7: Position = (140, 0)  

4. **Continue in Original Lane:**  
   - Maintain your position in the original lane for the remaining time.  
   - At T = 8: Position = (160, 0)  
   - At T = 9: Position = (180, 0)  
   - At T = 10: Position = (200, 0)

### **Summary of Positions:**
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| T = 0    | (0, 0)          |  
| T = 1    | (20, -2.5)      |  
| T = 2    | (40, -5)        |  
| T = 3    | (60, -5)        |  
| T = 4    | (80, -5)        |  
| T = 5    | (100, -5)       |  
| T = 6    | (120, -2.5)     |  
| T = 7    | (140, 0)        |  
| T = 8    | (160, 0)        |  
| T = 9    | (180, 0)        |  
| T = 10   | (200, 0)        |

### **Notes:**
- The vehicle¡¯s speed remains constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h), satisfying the minimum speed constraint (> 60 km/h).  
- Lane transitions are assumed to be smooth and linear for simplicity.  
- Adjustments can be made for real-world factors like acceleration, deceleration, or lane transition curves.
