To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we need to break the maneuver into key phases: **lane change**, **bypassing the obstruction**, and **returning to the original lane**. We¡¯ll calculate the vehicle¡¯s position (X, Y) at 1-second intervals, ensuring the speed remains above 60 km/h throughout.

### **Given:**
- **Starting position:** (X = 0.0, Y = 0)
- **Obstruction position:** (X = 100, Y = 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate:** Y = -5
- **Initial velocity:** 72.0 km/h = 20 m/s
- **Minimum speed:** 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s
- **Time interval:** T = 0 to 10 seconds

---

### **Route Planning:**

1. **Lane Change (T = 0 to 3 seconds):**
   - Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 (adjacent lane).
   - Maintain speed ¡Ö 20 m/s.
   - **Positions:**
     - T = 1: (20, -1.67)
     - T = 2: (40, -3.33)
     - T = 3: (60, -5)

2. **Bypassing Obstruction (T = 3 to 7 seconds):**
   - Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until X > 100.
   - Maintain speed ¡Ö 20 m/s.
   - **Positions:**
     - T = 4: (80, -5)
     - T = 5: (100, -5)
     - T = 6: (120, -5)
     - T = 7: (140, -5)

3. **Return to Original Lane (T = 7 to 10 seconds):**
   - Transition from Y = -5 back to Y = 0.
   - Maintain speed ¡Ö 20 m/s.
   - **Positions:**
     - T = 8: (160, -3.33)
     - T = 9: (180, -1.67)
     - T = 10: (200, 0)

### **Summary of Positions (T, X, Y):**
| T (seconds) | X (meters) | Y (meters) |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| 0           | 0.0        | 0.0        |
| 1           | 20         | -1.67      |
| 2           | 40         | -3.33      |
| 3           | 60         | -5         |
| 4           | 80         | -5         |
| 5           | 100        | -5         |
| 6           | 120        | -5         |
| 7           | 140        | -5         |
| 8           | 160        | -3.33      |
| 9           | 180        | -1.67      |
| 10          | 200        | 0.0        |

### **Key Assumptions:**
- The lane change is smooth and linear over 3 seconds.
- The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout.
- The obstruction is bypassed safely by staying in the adjacent lane until X > 100.

This plan ensures the vehicle navigates around the obstruction while maintaining a safe speed.
