To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we need to calculate the vehicle's position at critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. Here¡¯s the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Given:**
- **Starting position:** (X, Y) = (0.0, 0)
- **Obstruction position:** (X, Y) = (100, 0)
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate:** Y = -5
- **Initial velocity:** 72.0 km/h (20 m/s)
- **Minimum speed:** 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)
- **Time intervals:** T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 seconds

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h).
2. The lane change is smooth and takes 2 seconds to transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5.
3. The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until it bypasses the obstruction at X = 100.
4. After bypassing the obstruction, the vehicle transitions back to the original lane (Y = 0) in 2 seconds.

### **Route Planning:**

#### **1. Lane Change to Adjacent Lane (T = 0 to T = 2):**
- **Lateral movement:** Y transitions linearly from 0 to -5 over 2 seconds.
- **Longitudinal movement:** X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |
| 2        | 40    | -5    |

#### **2. Bypassing the Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 5):**
- **Lateral position:** Y = -5 (remain in the adjacent lane).
- **Longitudinal movement:** X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |

#### **3. Lane Change Back to Original Lane (T = 5 to T = 7):**
- **Lateral movement:** Y transitions linearly from -5 to 0 over 2 seconds.
- **Longitudinal movement:** X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 6        | 120   | -2.5  |
| 7        | 140   | 0     |

#### **4. Continuing in Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10):**
- **Lateral position:** Y = 0 (remain in the original lane).
- **Longitudinal movement:** X increases at 20 m/s.

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 8        | 160   | 0     |
| 9        | 180   | 0     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

---

### **Summary of Positions:**

| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m) |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 0        | 0     | 0     |
| 1        | 20    | -2.5  |
| 2        | 40    | -5    |
| 3        | 60    | -5    |
| 4        | 80    | -5    |
| 5        | 100   | -5    |
| 6        | 120   | -2.5  |
| 7        | 140   | 0     |
| 8        | 160   | 0     |
| 9        | 180   | 0     |
| 10       | 200   | 0     |

### **Key Points:**
- The vehicle successfully bypasses the obstruction at X = 100 while remaining in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
- The lane changes are completed smoothly within 2 seconds each.
- The vehicle maintains a speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout the maneuver.
