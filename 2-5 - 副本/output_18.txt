To plan your route around the obstruction, we'll break down the maneuver into key intervals, ensuring you maintain a speed above 60 km/h throughout. Here¡¯s the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Given:**
- Starting position: (0.0, 0)  
- Obstruction position: (100, 0)  
- Adjacent lane Y-coordinate: Y = -5  
- Initial speed: 72.0 km/h (20 m/s)  
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)  
- Time interval: 10 seconds  

---

### **Plan:**
1. **Lane Change to Adjacent Lane:**  
   - Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5.  
   - Assume the lane change takes 2 seconds.  

2. **Bypass the Obstruction:**  
   - Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) until you pass X = 100.  

3. **Return to Original Lane:**  
   - Transition back from Y = -5 to Y = 0.  
   - Assume this lane change also takes 2 seconds.

### **Position Estimates:**
We¡¯ll calculate your position (X, Y) at 1-second intervals.

#### **1. Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2):**
- At T = 0: (0.0, 0)  
- At T = 1: (20, -2.5)  
- At T = 2: (40, -5)  

#### **2. Bypassing Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6):**
- At T = 3: (60, -5)  
- At T = 4: (80, -5)  
- At T = 5: (100, -5)  
- At T = 6: (120, -5)  

#### **3. Return to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8):**
- At T = 7: (140, -2.5)  
- At T = 8: (160, 0)  

#### **4. Continue in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10):**
- At T = 9: (180, 0)  
- At T = 10: (200, 0)

### **Summary of Positions:**
| Time (s) | Position (X, Y) |  
|----------|-----------------|  
| 0        | (0.0, 0)        |  
| 1        | (20, -2.5)      |  
| 2        | (40, -5)        |  
| 3        | (60, -5)        |  
| 4        | (80, -5)        |  
| 5        | (100, -5)       |  
| 6        | (120, -5)       |  
| 7        | (140, -2.5)     |  
| 8        | (160, 0)        |  
| 9        | (180, 0)        |  
| 10       | (200, 0)        |

### **Key Notes:**
- Speed is maintained at 20 m/s (72 km/h) throughout.  
- Lane changes are smooth and take 2 seconds each.  
- The obstruction is bypassed safely by staying in the adjacent lane from X = 40 to X = 120.
