To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the vehicle's movement into three phases:

1. **Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)**
2. **Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)**
3. **Returning to the Original Lane (Y = 0)**

### Assumptions:
- **Initial Position**: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- **Obstruction Position**: (X, Y) = (100, 0)
- **Adjacent Lane Y-coordinate**: Y = -5
- **Initial Velocity**: 72.0 km/h = 20 m/s
- **Minimum Speed**: 60.0 km/h = 16.67 m/s
- **Time Interval**: 1 second

### Phase 1: Lane Change to the Adjacent Lane (Y = -5)
- **Time**: 0 to 2 seconds
- **Lateral Movement**: Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.
- **Lateral Speed**: 2.5 m/s (to cover 5 meters in 2 seconds)
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Continue at 20 m/s.

**Positions**:
- **T = 1s**: (20, -2.5)
- **T = 2s**: (40, -5)

### Phase 2: Bypassing the Obstruction (X = 100)
- **Time**: 2 to 6 seconds
- **Lateral Movement**: Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Continue at 20 m/s.

**Positions**:
- **T = 3s**: (60, -5)
- **T = 4s**: (80, -5)
- **T = 5s**: (100, -5)
- **T = 6s**: (120, -5)

### Phase 3: Returning to the Original Lane (Y = 0)
- **Time**: 6 to 8 seconds
- **Lateral Movement**: Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.
- **Lateral Speed**: 2.5 m/s (to cover 5 meters in 2 seconds)
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Continue at 20 m/s.

**Positions**:
- **T = 7s**: (140, -2.5)
- **T = 8s**: (160, 0)

### Final Phase: Continue in the Original Lane
- **Time**: 8 to 10 seconds
- **Lateral Movement**: Stay in the original lane (Y = 0).
- **Longitudinal Movement**: Continue at 20 m/s.

**Positions**:
- **T = 9s**: (180, 0)
- **T = 10s**: (200, 0)

### Summary of Positions:
- **T = 0s**: (0, 0)
- **T = 1s**: (20, -2.5)
- **T = 2s**: (40, -5)
- **T = 3s**: (60, -5)
- **T = 4s**: (80, -5)
- **T = 5s**: (100, -5)
- **T = 6s**: (120, -5)
- **T = 7s**: (140, -2.5)
- **T = 8s**: (160, 0)
- **T = 9s**: (180, 0)
- **T = 10s**: (200, 0)

This plan ensures that the vehicle bypasses the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h and safely returns to the original lane.
