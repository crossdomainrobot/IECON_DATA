To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we¡¯ll break down the vehicle¡¯s movement into critical intervals and calculate its position at each step. Here¡¯s the plan:

---

### **Given:**
- **Starting position:** (X, Y) = (0.0, 0)  
- **Obstruction position:** (X, Y) = (100, 0)  
- **Adjacent lane Y-coordinate:** Y = -5  
- **Initial velocity:** 72.0 km/h (20 m/s, since 1 km/h = 1/3.6 m/s)  
- **Minimum speed:** Must exceed 60 km/h (16.67 m/s)  
- **Time interval:** 1-second steps for 10 seconds  

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle accelerates or decelerates smoothly to change lanes.  
2. The lane change takes 2 seconds (transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5).  
3. The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane while bypassing the obstruction.  
4. After bypassing the obstruction, the vehicle transitions back to the original lane, which also takes 2 seconds.

### **Step-by-Step Plan:**

1. **Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2):**  
   - Transition from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 2 seconds.  
   - X-coordinate increases at 20 m/s:  
     - At T = 1: X = 20, Y = -2.5 (midway in lane change).  
     - At T = 2: X = 40, Y = -5 (fully in adjacent lane).  

2. **Bypassing Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6):**  
   - Continue in the adjacent lane (Y = -5) at 20 m/s.  
   - X-coordinate increases linearly:  
     - At T = 3: X = 60, Y = -5.  
     - At T = 4: X = 80, Y = -5.  
     - At T = 5: X = 100, Y = -5 (bypassing obstruction).  
     - At T = 6: X = 120, Y = -5.  

3. **Return to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8):**  
   - Transition from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 2 seconds.  
   - X-coordinate increases at 20 m/s:  
     - At T = 7: X = 140, Y = -2.5 (midway in lane change).  
     - At T = 8: X = 160, Y = 0 (fully in original lane).  

4. **Continue in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10):**  
   - Maintain speed of 20 m/s in the original lane (Y = 0).  
   - X-coordinate increases linearly:  
     - At T = 9: X = 180, Y = 0.  
     - At T = 10: X = 200, Y = 0.

### **Summary of Positions:**

| Time (s) | Position (X, Y)   |
|----------|-------------------|
| T = 0    | (0.0, 0)          |
| T = 1    | (20, -2.5)        |
| T = 2    | (40, -5)          |
| T = 3    | (60, -5)          |
| T = 4    | (80, -5)          |
| T = 5    | (100, -5)         |
| T = 6    | (120, -5)         |
| T = 7    | (140, -2.5)       |
| T = 8    | (160, 0)          |
| T = 9    | (180, 0)          |
| T = 10   | (200, 0)          |

### **Key Points:**
- The vehicle changes lanes smoothly over 2 seconds, bypasses the obstruction, and returns to the original lane.  
- Speed remains constant at 20 m/s (72 km/h), exceeding the minimum requirement of 16.67 m/s (60 km/h).  
- The obstruction is bypassed safely at T = 5, with the vehicle in the adjacent lane.
