To plan the route for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the movement into critical intervals. Here's the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Given:**
- Starting position: (X, Y) = (0, 0)
- Obstruction position: (X, Y) = (100, 0)
- Adjacent lane Y-coordinate: Y = -5
- Initial velocity: 72 km/h = 20 m/s
- Minimum speed: 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s
- Time intervals: T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 seconds

---

### **Assumptions:**
1. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h).
2. The lane change takes 2 seconds (smooth transition).
3. The vehicle remains in the adjacent lane while bypassing the obstruction (X = 100).
4. The vehicle returns to the original lane after passing the obstruction.

### **Route Plan:**

#### **Phase 1: Initial Movement (T = 0 to T = 2 seconds)**
- **Objective:** Transition from the outer lane (Y = 0) to the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
- **Position at T = 1 second:**  
  X = 20 m (20 m/s ¡Á 1 s), Y = -2.5 m (midway during lane change).  
  Position: (20, -2.5)
- **Position at T = 2 seconds:**  
  X = 40 m, Y = -5 m (fully in the adjacent lane).  
  Position: (40, -5)

#### **Phase 2: Bypassing Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6 seconds)**
- **Objective:** Stay in the adjacent lane while passing the obstruction at X = 100.
- **Position at T = 3 seconds:**  
  X = 60 m, Y = -5 m.  
  Position: (60, -5)
- **Position at T = 4 seconds:**  
  X = 80 m, Y = -5 m.  
  Position: (80, -5)
- **Position at T = 5 seconds:**  
  X = 100 m, Y = -5 m.  
  Position: (100, -5)
- **Position at T = 6 seconds:**  
  X = 120 m, Y = -5 m.  
  Position: (120, -5)

#### **Phase 3: Returning to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8 seconds)**
- **Objective:** Transition back to the original lane (Y = 0).
- **Position at T = 7 seconds:**  
  X = 140 m, Y = -2.5 m (midway during lane change).  
  Position: (140, -2.5)
- **Position at T = 8 seconds:**  
  X = 160 m, Y = 0 m (fully in the original lane).  
  Position: (160, 0)

#### **Phase 4: Continuing in Original Lane (T = 8 to T = 10 seconds)**
- **Objective:** Continue moving forward in the original lane.
- **Position at T = 9 seconds:**  
  X = 180 m, Y = 0 m.  
  Position: (180, 0)
- **Position at T = 10 seconds:**  
  X = 200 m, Y = 0 m.  
  Position: (200, 0)

### **Summary of Positions:**
| Time (s) | X (m) | Y (m)  |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 1        | 20    | -2.5   |
| 2        | 40    | -5     |
| 3        | 60    | -5     |
| 4        | 80    | -5     |
| 5        | 100   | -5     |
| 6        | 120   | -5     |
| 7        | 140   | -2.5   |
| 8        | 160   | 0      |
| 9        | 180   | 0      |
| 10       | 200   | 0      |

This plan ensures the vehicle bypasses the obstruction safely while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
