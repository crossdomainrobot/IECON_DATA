To plan the route for your vehicle to bypass the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we'll break down the process into critical intervals. Here's the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Assumptions and Conversions**
1. **Initial Speed**: 72.0 km/h = 20 m/s (since 1 km/h = \( \frac{1000}{3600} \) m/s).
2. **Time Intervals**: We'll evaluate the vehicle's position at 1-second intervals (T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10).
3. **Lane Transition**:
   - The outer lane is at Y = 0.
   - The adjacent lane is at Y = -5.
   - The obstruction is at X = 100.
4. **Lane Change Timing**:
   - Begin transitioning to the adjacent lane at T = 2.
   - Complete the transition to the adjacent lane by T = 4.
   - Begin transitioning back to the outer lane at T = 6.
   - Complete the transition back to the outer lane by T = 8.

### **Position Calculations**
1. **X-Position (Distance Along Road)**:
   - At constant speed (20 m/s), the X-position increases linearly: \( X = 20 \cdot T \).
2. **Y-Position (Lateral Positioning)**:
   - From T = 0 to T = 2: Stay in the outer lane (Y = 0).
   - From T = 2 to T = 4: Transition to the adjacent lane (Y changes linearly from 0 to -5).
   - From T = 4 to T = 6: Stay in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
   - From T = 6 to T = 8: Transition back to the outer lane (Y changes linearly from -5 to 0).
   - From T = 8 to T = 10: Stay in the outer lane (Y = 0).

### **Vehicle Positions at Critical Intervals**
| Time (T) | X-Position | Y-Position | Description                  |
|----------|------------|------------|------------------------------|
| 0        | 0          | 0          | Starting point.              |
| 1        | 20         | 0          | Moving in outer lane.        |
| 2        | 40         | 0          | Begin transitioning to adjacent lane. |
| 3        | 60         | -2.5       | Midway through lane change.  |
| 4        | 80         | -5         | Fully in adjacent lane.      |
| 5        | 100        | -5         | Bypassing obstruction.       |
| 6        | 120        | -5         | Begin transitioning back to outer lane. |
| 7        | 140        | -2.5       | Midway through lane change.  |
| 8        | 160        | 0          | Fully back in outer lane.    |
| 9        | 180        | 0          | Moving in outer lane.        |
| 10       | 200        | 0          | Moving in outer lane.        |

### **Key Points**
1. **Speed**: The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h), ensuring it stays above 60 km/h.
2. **Obstruction Bypass**: The obstruction is bypassed at T = 5 (X = 100), while staying in the adjacent lane (Y = -5).
3. **Lane Transitions**: Smooth transitions are achieved over 2 seconds each, ensuring safety and stability.

This plan ensures the vehicle navigates around the obstruction efficiently while maintaining the required speed.
