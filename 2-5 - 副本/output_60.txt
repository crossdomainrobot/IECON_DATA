To construct a route plan for navigating around the obstruction, we'll break down the vehicle's movement into critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. Here's the step-by-step plan:

---

### **Assumptions and Initial Conditions**
1. **Starting Position**: (X, Y) = (0.0, 0.0)
2. **Obstruction Position**: (X, Y) = (100, 0.0)
3. **Adjacent Lane Position**: Y = -5
4. **Initial Velocity**: 72.0 km/h = 20 m/s
5. **Minimum Speed Constraint**: Must exceed 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s
6. **Time Intervals**: T = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 seconds

---

### **Route Plan**
The vehicle will:
1. **Transition to the adjacent lane (Y = -5)** between T = 0 and T = 3 seconds.
2. **Bypass the obstruction** while maintaining Y = -5 until X > 100.
3. **Return to the original lane (Y = 0)** between T = 7 and T = 10 seconds.

### **Position Estimates**
We calculate the vehicle's position at each second, assuming constant speed (20 m/s) and smooth lane transitions.

| Time (T) | X (Distance) | Y (Lateral Position) | Notes                          |
|----------|--------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| 0        | 0.0          | 0.0                  | Starting position              |
| 1        | 20.0         | -1.67                | Transitioning to adjacent lane |
| 2        | 40.0         | -3.33                | Transitioning to adjacent lane |
| 3        | 60.0         | -5.0                 | Fully in adjacent lane         |
| 4        | 80.0         | -5.0                 | Bypassing obstruction          |
| 5        | 100.0        | -5.0                 | Passing obstruction            |
| 6        | 120.0        | -5.0                 | Bypassing obstruction          |
| 7        | 140.0        | -3.33                | Transitioning to original lane |
| 8        | 160.0        | -1.67                | Transitioning to original lane |
| 9        | 180.0        | 0.0                  | Fully in original lane         |
| 10       | 200.0        | 0.0                  | Mission complete               |

### **Explanation of Movements**
1. **Lane Transition (T = 0 to T = 3)**:
   - The vehicle moves laterally from Y = 0 to Y = -5 over 3 seconds, ensuring a smooth transition.
   - Lateral velocity: ¦¤Y = -5 / 3 = -1.67 m/s.

2. **Bypassing Obstruction (T = 3 to T = 7)**:
   - The vehicle maintains Y = -5 while traveling forward at 20 m/s.
   - At T = 5, the vehicle reaches X = 100, directly alongside the obstruction.

3. **Returning to Original Lane (T = 7 to T = 10)**:
   - The vehicle moves laterally from Y = -5 to Y = 0 over 3 seconds.
   - Lateral velocity: ¦¤Y = 5 / 3 = 1.67 m/s.

### **Speed Constraint**
Throughout the maneuver, the vehicle's forward speed remains at 20 m/s (72 km/h), which exceeds the minimum requirement of 16.67 m/s (60 km/h).

---

### **Final Positions**
- At T = 10, the vehicle is at (200.0, 0.0), having successfully bypassed the obstruction and returned to the original lane.

This plan ensures a safe and efficient navigation around the obstruction while adhering to speed constraints.
