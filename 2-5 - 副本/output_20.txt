To plan the lane transition and bypass the obstruction while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h, we need to calculate the vehicle's position at critical intervals over the next 10 seconds. Here's the step-by-step plan:

### Given:
- Initial position: \( (X, Y) = (0.0, 0) \)
- Obstruction at \( (100, 0) \)
- Adjacent lane at \( Y = -5 \)
- Initial velocity: \( 72.0 \, \text{km/h} = 20 \, \text{m/s} \)
- Minimum speed: \( 60 \, \text{km/h} = 16.67 \, \text{m/s} \)
- Time frame: \( T = 0 \) to \( T = 10 \) seconds

### Assumptions:
1. The vehicle accelerates or decelerates smoothly to maintain speed above 60 km/h.
2. The lane change is completed within 2 seconds (standard for smooth lane transitions).
3. The vehicle travels at a constant speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) during the lane change.

### Plan:
1. **Lane Change (T = 0 to T = 2):**  
   - Move from \( Y = 0 \) to \( Y = -5 \) in 2 seconds.
   - During this time, the vehicle continues to move forward at 20 m/s.

2. **Bypass Obstruction (T = 2 to T = 6):**  
   - Stay in the adjacent lane \( Y = -5 \) while traveling past the obstruction at \( X = 100 \).

3. **Return to Original Lane (T = 6 to T = 8):**  
   - Move from \( Y = -5 \) back to \( Y = 0 \) in 2 seconds.

4. **Continue Travel (T = 8 to T = 10):**  
   - Stay in the original lane \( Y = 0 \) and continue forward.

### Position Estimates:
- **T = 0:** \( (0, 0) \)
- **T = 1:**  
  - \( X = 20 \times 1 = 20 \)  
  - \( Y = 0 + \frac{-5}{2} \times 1 = -2.5 \)  
  - Position: \( (20, -2.5) \)

- **T = 2:**  
  - \( X = 20 \times 2 = 40 \)  
  - \( Y = -5 \)  
  - Position: \( (40, -5) \)

- **T = 3:**  
  - \( X = 20 \times 3 = 60 \)  
  - \( Y = -5 \)  
  - Position: \( (60, -5) \)

- **T = 4:**  
  - \( X = 20 \times 4 = 80 \)  
  - \( Y = -5 \)  
  - Position: \( (80, -5) \)

- **T = 5:**  
  - \( X = 20 \times 5 = 100 \)  
  - \( Y = -5 \)  
  - Position: \( (100, -5) \)

- **T = 6:**  
  - \( X = 20 \times 6 = 120 \)  
  - \( Y = -5 + \frac{5}{2} \times 0 = -5 \)  
  - Position: \( (120, -5) \)

- **T = 7:**  
  - \( X = 20 \times 7 = 140 \)  
  - \( Y = -5 + \frac{5}{2} \times 1 = -2.5 \)  
  - Position: \( (140, -2.5) \)

- **T = 8:**  
  - \( X = 20 \times 8 = 160 \)  
  - \( Y = 0 \)  
  - Position: \( (160, 0) \)

- **T = 9:**  
  - \( X = 20 \times 9 = 180 \)  
  - \( Y = 0 \)  
  - Position: \( (180, 0) \)

- **T = 10:**  
  - \( X = 20 \times 10 = 200 \)  
  - \( Y = 0 \)  
  - Position: \( (200, 0) \)

### Summary:
The vehicle successfully bypasses the obstruction by transitioning to the adjacent lane, staying there until past the obstruction, and then returning to the original lane while maintaining a speed above 60 km/h.
